<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
<p>Mary Wollstonecraft was born on the 27th of April, 1759.&nbsp;
Her father&mdash;a quick-tempered and unsettled man, capable of
beating wife, or child, or dog&mdash;was the son of a
manufacturer who made money in Spitalfields, when Spitalfields
was prosperous.&nbsp; Her mother was a rigorous Irishwoman, of
the Dixons of Ballyshannon.&nbsp; Edward John
Wollstonecraft&mdash;of whose children, besides Mary, the second
child, three sons and two daughters lived to be men and
women&mdash;in course of the got rid of about ten thousand
pounds, which had been left him by his father.&nbsp; He began to
get rid of it by farming.&nbsp; Mary Wollstonecraft&rsquo;s
first-remembered home was in a farm at Epping.&nbsp; When she was
five years old the family moved to another farm, by the
Chelmsford Road.&nbsp; When she was between six and seven years
old they moved again, to the neighbourhood of Barking.&nbsp;
There they remained three years before the next move, which was
to a farm near Beverley, in Yorkshire.&nbsp; In Yorkshire they
remained six years, and Mary Wollstonecraft had there what
education fell to her lot between the ages of ten and
sixteen.&nbsp; Edward John Wollstonecraft then gave up farming to
venture upon a commercial speculation.&nbsp; This caused him to
live for a year and a half at Queen&rsquo;s Row, Hoxton.&nbsp;
His daughter Mary was then sixteen; and while at Hoxton she had
her education advanced by the friendly care of a deformed
clergyman&mdash;a Mr. Clare&mdash;who lived next door, and stayed
so much at home that his one pair of shoes had lasted him for
fourteen years.</p>
<p>But Mary Wollstonecraft&rsquo;s chief friend at this time was
an accomplished girl only two years older than herself, who
maintained her father, mother, and family by skill in
drawing.&nbsp; Her name was Frances Blood, and she especially, by
her example and direct instruction, drew out her young
friend&rsquo;s powers.&nbsp; In 1776, Mary Wollstonecraft&rsquo;s
father, a rolling stone, rolled into Wales.&nbsp; Again he was a
farmer.&nbsp; Next year again he was a Londoner; and Mary had
influence enough to persuade him to choose a house at Walworth,
where she would be near to her friend Fanny.&nbsp; Then, however,
the conditions of her home life caused her to be often on the
point of going away to earn a living for herself.&nbsp; In 1778,
when she was nineteen, Mary Wollstonecraft did leave home, to
take a situation as companion with a rich tradesman&rsquo;s widow
at Bath, of whom it was said that none of her companions could
stay with her.&nbsp; Mary Wollstonecraft, nevertheless, stayed
two years with the difficult widow, and made herself
respected.&nbsp; Her mother&rsquo;s failing health then caused
Mary to return to her.&nbsp; The father was then living at
Enfield, and trying to save the small remainder of his means by
not venturing upon any business at all.&nbsp; The mother died
after long suffering, wholly dependent on her daughter
Mary&rsquo;s constant care.&nbsp; The mother&rsquo;s last words
were often quoted by Mary Wollstonecraft in her own last years of
distress&mdash;&ldquo;A little patience, and all will be
over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the mother&rsquo;s death, Mary Wollstonecraft left home
again, to live with her friend, Fanny Blood, who was at Walham
Green.&nbsp; In 1782 she went to nurse a married sister through a
dangerous illness.&nbsp; The father&rsquo;s need of support next
pressed upon her.&nbsp; He had spent not only his own money, but
also the little that had been specially reserved for his
children.&nbsp; It is said to be the privilege of a passionate
man that he always gets what he wants; he gets to be avoided, and
they never find a convenient corner of their own who shut
themselves out from the kindly fellowship of life.</p>
<p>In 1783 Mary Wollstonecraft&mdash;aged twenty-four&mdash;with
two of her sisters, joined Fanny Blood in setting up a day school
at Islington, which was removed in a few months to Newington
Green.&nbsp; Early in 1785 Fanny Blood, far gone in consumption,
sailed for Lisbon to marry an Irish surgeon who was settled
there.&nbsp; After her marriage it was evident that she had but a
few months to live; Mary Wollstonecraft, deaf to all opposing
counsel, then left her school, and, with help of money from a
friendly woman, she went out to nurse her, and was by her when
she died.&nbsp; Mary Wollstonecraft remembered her loss ten years
afterwards in these &ldquo;Letters from Sweden and Norway,&rdquo;
when she wrote: &ldquo;The grave has closed over a dear friend,
the friend of my youth; still she is present with me, and I hear
her soft voice warbling as I stray over the heath.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Wollstonecraft left Lisbon for England late in December,
1785.&nbsp; When she came back she found Fanny&rsquo;s poor
parents anxious to go back to Ireland; and as she had been often
told that she could earn by writing, she wrote a pamphlet of 162
small pages&mdash;&ldquo;Thoughts on the Education of
Daughters&rdquo;&mdash;and got ten pounds for it.&nbsp; This she
gave to her friend&rsquo;s parents to enable them to go back to
their kindred.&nbsp; In all she did there is clear evidence of an
ardent, generous, impulsive nature.&nbsp; One day her friend
Fanny Blood had repined at the unhappy surroundings in the home
she was maintaining for her father and mother, and longed for a
little home of her own to do her work in.&nbsp; Her friend
quietly found rooms, got furniture together, and told her that
her little home was ready; she had only to walk into it.&nbsp;
Then it seemed strange to Mary Wollstonecraft that Fanny Blood
was withheld by thoughts that had not been uppermost in the mood
of complaint.&nbsp; She thought her friend irresolute, where she
had herself been generously rash.&nbsp; Her end would have been
happier had she been helped, as many are, by that calm influence
of home in which some knowledge of the world passes from father
and mother to son and daughter, without visible teaching and
preaching, in easiest companionship of young and old from day to
day.</p>
<p>The little payment for her pamphlet on the &ldquo;Education of
Daughters&rdquo; caused Mary Wollstonecraft to think more
seriously of earning by her pen.&nbsp; The pamphlet seems also to
have advanced her credit as a teacher.&nbsp; After giving up her
day school, she spent some weeks at Eton with the Rev. Mr. Prior,
one of the masters there, who recommended her as governess to the
daughters of Lord Kingsborough, an Irish viscount, eldest son of
the Earl of Kingston.&nbsp; Her way of teaching was by winning
love, and she obtained the warm affection of the eldest of her
pupils, who became afterwards Countess Mount-Cashel.&nbsp; In the
summer of 1787, Lord Kingsborough&rsquo;s family, including Mary
Wollstonecraft, was at Bristol Hot-wells, before going to the
Continent.&nbsp; While there, Mary Wollstonecraft wrote her
little tale published as &ldquo;Mary, a Fiction,&rdquo; wherein
there was much based on the memory of her own friendship for
Fanny Blood.</p>
<p>The publisher of Mary Wollstonecraft&rsquo;s &ldquo;Thoughts
on the Education of Daughters&rdquo; was the same Joseph Johnson
who in 1785 was the publisher of Cowper&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Task.&rdquo;&nbsp; With her little story written and a
little money saved, the resolve to live by her pen could now be
carried out.&nbsp; Mary Wollstonecraft, therefore, parted from
her friends at Bristol, went to London, saw her publisher, and
frankly told him her determination.&nbsp; He met her with
fatherly kindness, and received her as a guest in his house while
she was making her arrangements.&nbsp; At Michaelmas, 1787, she
settled in a house in George Street, on the Surrey side of
Blackfriars Bridge.&nbsp; There she produced a little book for
children, of &ldquo;Original Stories from Real Life,&rdquo; and
earned by drudgery for Joseph Johnson.&nbsp; She translated, she
abridged, she made a volume of Selections, and she wrote for an
&ldquo;Analytical Review,&rdquo; which Mr. Johnson founded in the
middle of the year 1788.&nbsp; Among the books translated by her
was Necker &ldquo;On the Importance of Religious
Opinions.&rdquo;&nbsp; Among the books abridged by her was
Salzmann&rsquo;s &ldquo;Elements of Morality.&rdquo;&nbsp; With
all this hard work she lived as sparely as she could, that she
might help her family.&nbsp; She supported her father.&nbsp; That
she might enable her sisters to earn their living as teachers,
she sent one of them to Paris, and maintained her there for two
years; the other she placed in a school near London as
parlour-boarder until she was admitted into it as a paid
teacher.&nbsp; She placed one brother at Woolwich to qualify for
the Navy, and he obtained a lieutenant&rsquo;s commission.&nbsp;
For another brother, articled to an attorney whom he did not
like, she obtained a transfer of indentures; and when it became
clear that his quarrel was more with law than with the lawyers,
she placed him with a farmer before fitting him out for
emigration to America.&nbsp; She then sent him, so well prepared
for his work there that he prospered well.&nbsp; She tried even
to disentangle her father&rsquo;s affairs; but the confusion in
them was beyond her powers of arrangement.&nbsp; Added to all
this faithful work, she took upon herself the charge of an orphan
child, seven years old, whose mother had been in the number of
her friends.&nbsp; That was the life of Mary Wollstonecraft,
thirty years old, in 1789, the year of the Fall of the Bastille;
the noble life now to be touched in its enthusiasms by the spirit
of the Revolution, to be caught in the great storm, shattered,
and lost among its wrecks.</p>
<p>To Burke&rsquo;s attack on the French Revolution Mary
Wollstonecraft wrote an Answer&mdash;one of many answers provoked
by it&mdash;that attracted much attention.&nbsp; This was
followed by her &ldquo;Vindication of the Rights of Woman,&rdquo;
while the air was full of declamation on the &ldquo;Rights of
Man.&rdquo;&nbsp; The claims made in this little book were in
advance of the opinion of that day, but they are claims that have
in our day been conceded.&nbsp; They are certainly not
revolutionary in the opinion of the world that has become a
hundred years older since the book was written.</p>
<p>At this the Mary Wollstonecraft had moved to rooms in Store
Street, Bedford Square.&nbsp; She was fascinated by Fuseli the
painter, and he was a married man.&nbsp; She felt herself to be
too strongly drawn towards him, and she went to Paris at the
close of the year 1792, to break the spell.&nbsp; She felt lonely
and sad, and was not the happier for being in a mansion lent to
her, from which the owner was away, and in which she lived
surrounded by his servants.&nbsp; Strong womanly instincts were
astir within her, and they were not all wise folk who had been
drawn around her by her generous enthusiasm for the new hopes of
the world, that made it then, as Wordsworth felt, a very heaven
to the young.</p>
<p>Four months after she had gone to Paris, Mary Wollstonecraft
met at the house of a merchant, with whose wife she had become
intimate, an American named Gilbert Imlay.&nbsp; He won her
affections.&nbsp; That was in April, 1793.&nbsp; He had no means,
and she had home embarrassments, for which she was unwilling that
he should become in any way responsible.&nbsp; A part of the new
dream in some minds then was of a love too pure to need or bear
the bondage of authority.&nbsp; The mere forced union of marriage
ties implied, it was said, a distrust of fidelity.&nbsp; When
Gilbert Imlay would have married Mary Wollstonecraft, she herself
refused to bind him; she would keep him legally exempt from her
responsibilities towards the father, sisters, brothers, whom she
was supporting.&nbsp; She took his name and called herself his
wife, when the French Convention, indignant at the conduct of the
British Government, issue a decree from the effects of which she
would escape as the wife of a citizen of the United States.&nbsp;
But she did not marry.&nbsp; She witnessed many of the horrors
that came of the loosened passions of an untaught populace.&nbsp;
A child was born to her&mdash;a girl whom she named after the
dead friend of her own girlhood.&nbsp; And then she found that
she had leant upon a reed.&nbsp; She was neglected; and was at
last forsaken.&nbsp; Having sent her to London, Imlay there
visited her, to explain himself away.&nbsp; She resolved on
suicide, and in dissuading her from that he gave her hope
again.&nbsp; He needed somebody who had good judgment, and who
cared for his interests, to represent him in some business
affairs in Norway.&nbsp; She undertook to act for him, and set
out on the voyage only a week after she had determined to destroy
herself.</p>
<p>The interest of this book which describes her travel is
quickened by a knowledge of the heart-sorrow that underlies it
all.&nbsp; Gilbert Imlay had promised to meet her upon her
return, and go with her to Switzerland.&nbsp; But the letters she
had from him in Sweden and Norway were cold, and she came back to
find that she was wholly forsaken for an actress from a strolling
company of players.&nbsp; Then she went up the river to drown
herself.&nbsp; She paced the road at Putney on an October night,
in 1795, in heavy rain, until her clothes were drenched, that she
might sink more surely, and then threw herself from the top of
Putney Bridge.</p>
<p>She was rescued, and lived on with deadened spirit.&nbsp; In
1796 these &ldquo;Letters from Sweden and Norway&rdquo; were
published.&nbsp; Early in 1797 she was married to William
Godwin.&nbsp; On the 10th of September in the same year, at the
age of thirty-eight, Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin died, after the
birth of the daughter who lived to become the wife of
Shelley.&nbsp; The mother also would have lived, if a womanly
feeling, in itself to be respected, had not led her also to
unwise departure from the customs of the world.&nbsp; Peace be to
her memory.&nbsp; None but kind thoughts can dwell upon the life
of this too faithful disciple of Rousseau.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">H. M.</p>
<h2>LETTER I.</h2>
<p>Eleven days of weariness on board a vessel not intended for
the accommodation of passengers have so exhausted my spirits, to
say nothing of the other causes, with which you are already
sufficiently acquainted, that it is with some difficulty I adhere
to my determination of giving you my observations, as I travel
through new scenes, whilst warmed with the impression they have
made on me.</p>
<p>The captain, as I mentioned to you, promised to put me on
shore at Arendall or Gothenburg in his way to Elsineur, but
contrary winds obliged us to pass both places during the
night.&nbsp; In the morning, however, after we had lost sight of
the entrance of the latter bay, the vessel was becalmed; and the
captain, to oblige me, hanging out a signal for a pilot, bore
down towards the shore.</p>
<p>My attention was particularly directed to the lighthouse, and
you can scarcely imagine with what anxiety I watched two long
hours for a boat to emancipate me; still no one appeared.&nbsp;
Every cloud that flitted on the horizon was hailed as a
liberator, till approaching nearer, like most of the prospects
sketched by hope, it dissolved under the eye into
disappointment.</p>
<p>Weary of expectation, I then began to converse with the
captain on the subject, and from the tenor of the information my
questions drew forth I soon concluded that if I waited for a boat
I had little chance of getting on shore at this place.&nbsp;
Despotism, as is usually the case, I found had here cramped the
industry of man.&nbsp; The pilots being paid by the king, and
scantily, they will not run into any danger, or even quit their
hovels, if they can possibly avoid it, only to fulfil what is
termed their duty.&nbsp; How different is it on the English
coast, where, in the most stormy weather, boats immediately hail
you, brought out by the expectation of extraordinary profit.</p>
<p>Disliking to sail for Elsineur, and still more to lie at
anchor or cruise about the coast for several days, I exerted all
my rhetoric to prevail on the captain to let me have the
ship&rsquo;s boat, and though I added the most forcible of
arguments, I for a long the addressed him in vain.</p>
<p>It is a kind of rule at sea not to send out a boat.&nbsp; The
captain was a good-natured man; but men with common minds seldom
break through general rules.&nbsp; Prudence is ever the resort of
weakness, and they rarely go as far as they may in any
undertaking who are determined not to go beyond it on any
account.&nbsp; If, however, I had some trouble with the captain,
I did not lose much time with the sailors, for they, all
alacrity, hoisted out the boat the moment I obtained permission,
and promised to row me to the lighthouse.</p>
<p>I did not once allow myself to doubt of obtaining a conveyance
from thence round the rocks&mdash;and then away for
Gothenburg&mdash;confinement is so unpleasant.</p>
<p>The day was fine, and I enjoyed the water till, approaching
the little island, poor Marguerite, whose timidity always acts as
a feeler before her adventuring spirit, began to wonder at our
not seeing any inhabitants.&nbsp; I did not listen to her.&nbsp;
But when, on landing, the same silence prevailed, I caught the
alarm, which was not lessened by the sight of two old men whom we
forced out of their wretched hut.&nbsp; Scarcely human in their
appearance, we with difficulty obtained an intelligible reply to
our questions, the result of which was that they had no boat, and
were not allowed to quit their post on any pretence.&nbsp; But
they informed us that there was at the other side, eight or ten
miles over, a pilot&rsquo;s dwelling.&nbsp; Two guineas tempted
the sailors to risk the captain&rsquo;s displeasure, and once
more embark to row me over.</p>
<p>The weather was pleasant, and the appearance of the shore so
grand that I should have enjoyed the two hours it took to reach
it, but for the fatigue which was too visible in the countenances
of the sailors, who, instead of uttering a complaint, were, with
the thoughtless hilarity peculiar to them, joking about the
possibility of the captain&rsquo;s taking advantage of a slight
westerly breeze, which was springing up, to sail without
them.&nbsp; Yet, in spite of their good humour, I could not help
growing uneasy when the shore, receding, as it were, as we
advanced, seemed to promise no end to their toil.&nbsp; This
anxiety increased when, turning into the most picturesque bay I
ever saw, my eyes sought in vain for the vestige of a human
habitation.&nbsp; Before I could determine what step to take in
such a dilemma (for I could not bear to think of returning to the
ship), the sight of a barge relieved me, and we hastened towards
it for information.&nbsp; We were immediately directed to pass
some jutting rocks, when we should see a pilot&rsquo;s hut.</p>
<p>There was a solemn silence in this scene which made itself be
felt.&nbsp; The sunbeams that played on the ocean, scarcely
ruffled by the lightest breeze, contrasted with the huge dark
rocks, that looked like the rude materials of creation forming
the barrier of unwrought space, forcibly struck me, but I should
not have been sorry if the cottage had not appeared equally
tranquil.&nbsp; Approaching a retreat where strangers, especially
women, so seldom appeared, I wondered that curiosity did not
bring the beings who inhabited it to the windows or door.&nbsp; I
did not immediately recollect that men who remain so near the
brute creation, as only to exert themselves to find the food
necessary to sustain life, have little or no imagination to call
forth the curiosity necessary to fructify the faint glimmerings
of mind which entitle them to rank as lords of the
creation.&nbsp; Had they either they could not contentedly remain
rooted in the clods they so indolently cultivate.</p>
<p>Whilst the sailors went to seek for the sluggish inhabitants,
these conclusions occurred to me; and, recollecting the extreme
fondness which the Parisians ever testify for novelty, their very
curiosity appeared to me a proof of the progress they had made in
refinement.&nbsp; Yes, in the art of living&mdash;in the art of
escaping from the cares which embarrass the first steps towards
the attainment of the pleasures of social life.</p>
<p>The pilots informed the sailors that they were under the
direction of a lieutenant retired from the service, who spoke
English; adding that they could do nothing without his orders,
and even the offer of money could hardly conquer their laziness
and prevail on them to accompany us to his dwelling.&nbsp; They
would not go with me alone, which I wanted them to have done,
because I wished to dismiss the sailors as soon as
possible.&nbsp; Once more we rowed off, they following tardily,
till, turning round another bold protuberance of the rocks, we
saw a boat making towards us, and soon learnt that it was the
lieutenant himself, coming with some earnestness to see who we
were.</p>
<p>To save the sailors any further toil, I had my baggage
instantly removed into his boat; for, as he could speak English,
a previous parley was not necessary, though Marguerite&rsquo;s
respect for me could hardly keep her from expressing the fear,
strongly marked on her countenance, which my putting ourselves
into the power of a strange man excited.&nbsp; He pointed out his
cottage; and, drawing near to it, I was not sorry to see a female
figure, though I had not, like Marguerite, been thinking of
robberies, murders, or the other evil which instantly, as the
sailors would have said, runs foul of a woman&rsquo;s
imagination.</p>
<p>On entering I was still better pleased to find a clean house,
with some degree of rural elegance.&nbsp; The beds were of
muslin, coarse it is true, but dazzlingly white; and the floor
was strewed over with little sprigs of juniper (the custom, as I
afterwards found, of the country), which formed a contrast with
the curtains, and produced an agreeable sensation of freshness,
to soften the ardour of noon.&nbsp; Still nothing was so pleasing
as the alacrity of hospitality&mdash;all that the house afforded
was quickly spread on the whitest linen.&nbsp; Remember, I had
just left the vessel, where, without being fastidious, I had
continually been disgusted.&nbsp; Fish, milk, butter, and cheese,
and, I am sorry to add, brandy, the bane of this country, were
spread on the board.&nbsp; After we had dined hospitality made
them, with some degree of mystery, bring us some excellent
coffee.&nbsp; I did not then know that it was prohibited.</p>
<p>The good man of the house apologised for coming in
continually, but declared that he was so glad to speak English he
could not stay out.&nbsp; He need not have apologised; I was
equally glad of his company.&nbsp; With the wife I could only
exchange smiles, and she was employed observing the make of our
clothes.&nbsp; My hands, I found, had first led her to discover
that I was the lady.&nbsp; I had, of course, my quantum of
reverences; for the politeness of the north seems to partake of
the coldness of the climate and the rigidity of its iron-sinewed
rocks.&nbsp; Amongst the peasantry there is, however, so much of
the simplicity of the golden age in this land of flint&mdash;so
much overflowing of heart and fellow-feeling, that only
benevolence and the honest sympathy of nature diffused smiles
over my countenance when they kept me standing, regardless of my
fatigue, whilst they dropped courtesy after courtesy.</p>
<p>The situation of this house was beautiful, though chosen for
convenience.&nbsp; The master being the officer who commanded all
the pilots on the coast, and the person appointed to guard
wrecks, it was necessary for him to fix on a spot that would
overlook the whole bay.&nbsp; As he had seen some service, he
wore, not without a pride I thought becoming, a badge to prove
that he had merited well of his country.&nbsp; It was happy, I
thought, that he had been paid in honour, for the stipend he
received was little more than twelve pounds a year.&nbsp; I do
not trouble myself or you with the calculation of Swedish
ducats.&nbsp; Thus, my friend, you perceive the necessity of
perquisites.&nbsp; This same narrow policy runs through
everything.&nbsp; I shall have occasion further to animadvert on
it.</p>
<p>Though my host amused me with an account of himself, which
gave me aim idea of the manners of the people I was about to
visit, I was eager to climb the rocks to view the country, and
see whether the honest tars had regained their ship.&nbsp; With
the help of the lieutenant&rsquo;s telescope, I saw the vessel
under way with a fair though gentle gale.&nbsp; The sea was calm,
playful even as the most shallow stream, and on the vast basin I
did not see a dark speck to indicate the boat.&nbsp; My
conductors were consequently arrived.</p>
<p>Straying further, my eye was attracted by the sight of some
heartsease that peeped through the rocks.&nbsp; I caught at it as
a good omen, and going to preserve it in a letter that had not
conveyed balm to my heart, a cruel remembrance suffused my eyes;
but it passed away like an April shower.&nbsp; If you are deep
read in Shakespeare, you will recollect that this was the little
western flower tinged by love&rsquo;s dart, which &ldquo;maidens
call love in idleness.&rdquo;&nbsp; The gaiety of my babe was
unmixed; regardless of omens or sentiments, she found a few wild
strawberries more grateful than flowers or fancies.</p>
<p>The lieutenant informed me that this was a commodious
bay.&nbsp; Of that I could not judge, though I felt its
picturesque beauty.&nbsp; Rocks were piled on rocks, forming a
suitable bulwark to the ocean.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come no
further,&rdquo; they emphatically said, turning their dark sides
to the waves to augment the idle roar.&nbsp; The view was
sterile; still little patches of earth of the most exquisite
verdure, enamelled with the sweetest wild flowers, seemed to
promise the goats and a few straggling cows luxurious
herbage.&nbsp; How silent and peaceful was the scene!&nbsp; I
gazed around with rapture, and felt more of that spontaneous
pleasure which gives credibility to our expectation of happiness
than I had for a long, long time before.&nbsp; I forgot the
horrors I had witnessed in France, which had cast a gloom over
all nature, and suffering the enthusiasm of my
character&mdash;too often, gracious God! damped by the tears of
disappointed affection&mdash;to be lighted up afresh, care took
wing while simple fellow-feeling expanded my heart.</p>
<p>To prolong this enjoyment, I readily assented to the proposal
of our host to pay a visit to a family, the master of which spoke
English, who was the drollest dog in the country, he added,
repeating some of his stories with a hearty laugh.</p>
<p>I walked on, still delighted with the rude beauties of the
scene; for the sublime often gave place imperceptibly to the
beautiful, dilating the emotions which were painfully
concentrated.</p>
<p>When we entered this abode, the largest I had yet seen, I was
introduced to a numerous family; but the father, from whom I was
led to expect so much entertainment, was absent.&nbsp; The
lieutenant consequently was obliged to be the interpreter of our
reciprocal compliments.&nbsp; The phrases were awkwardly
transmitted, it is true; but looks and gestures were sufficient
to make them intelligible and interesting.&nbsp; The girls were
all vivacity, and respect for me could scarcely keep them from
romping with my host, who, asking for a pinch of snuff, was
presented with a box, out of which an artificial mouse, fastened
to the bottom, sprang.&nbsp; Though this trick had doubtless been
played the out of mind, yet the laughter it excited was not less
genuine.</p>
<p>They were overflowing with civility; but, to prevent their
almost killing my babe with kindness, I was obliged to shorten my
visit; and two or three of the girls accompanied us, bringing
with them a part of whatever the house afforded to contribute
towards rendering my supper more plentiful; and plentiful in fact
it was, though I with difficulty did honour to some of the
dishes, not relishing the quantity of sugar and spices put into
everything.&nbsp; At supper my host told me bluntly that I was a
woman of observation, for I asked him <i>men&rsquo;s
questions</i>.</p>
<p>The arrangements for my journey were quickly made.&nbsp; I
could only have a car with post-horses, as I did not choose to
wait till a carriage could be sent for to Gothenburg.&nbsp; The
expense of my journey (about one or two and twenty English miles)
I found would not amount to more than eleven or twelve shillings,
paying, he assured me, generously.&nbsp; I gave him a guinea and
a half.&nbsp; But it was with the greatest difficulty that I
could make him take so much&mdash;indeed anything&mdash;for my
lodging and fare.&nbsp; He declared that it was next to robbing
me, explaining how much I ought to pay on the road.&nbsp;
However, as I was positive, he took the guinea for himself; but,
as a condition, insisted on accompanying me, to prevent my
meeting with any trouble or imposition on the way.</p>
<p>I then retired to my apartment with regret.&nbsp; The night
was so fine that I would gladly have rambled about much longer,
yet, recollecting that I must rise very early, I reluctantly went
to bed; but my senses had been so awake, and my imagination still
continued so busy, that I sought for rest in vain.&nbsp; Rising
before six, I scented the sweet morning air; I had long before
heard the birds twittering to hail the dawning day, though it
could scarcely have been allowed to have departed.</p>
<p>Nothing, in fact, can equal the beauty of the northern
summer&rsquo;s evening and night, if night it may be called that
only wants the glare of day, the full light which frequently
seems so impertinent, for I could write at midnight very well
without a candle.&nbsp; I contemplated all Nature at rest; the
rocks, even grown darker in their appearance, looked as if they
partook of the general repose, and reclined more heavily on their
foundation.&nbsp; &ldquo;What,&rdquo; I exclaimed, &ldquo;is this
active principle which keeps me still awake?&nbsp; Why fly my
thoughts abroad, when everything around me appears at
home?&rdquo;&nbsp; My child was sleeping with equal
calmness&mdash;innocent and sweet as the closing flowers.&nbsp;
Some recollections, attached to the idea of home, mingled with
reflections respecting the state of society I had been
contemplating that evening, made a tear drop on the rosy cheek I
had just kissed, and emotions that trembled on the brink of
ecstasy and agony gave a poignancy to my sensations which made me
feel more alive than usual.</p>
<p>What are these imperious sympathies?&nbsp; How frequently has
melancholy and even misanthropy taken possession of me, when the
world has disgusted me, and friends have proved unkind.&nbsp; I
have then considered myself as a particle broken off from the
grand mass of mankind; I was alone, till some involuntary
sympathetic emotion, like the attraction of adhesion, made me
feel that I was still a part of a mighty whole, from which I
could not sever myself&mdash;not, perhaps, for the reflection has
been carried very far, by snapping the thread of an existence,
which loses its charms in proportion as the cruel experience of
life stops or poisons the current of the heart.&nbsp; Futurity,
what hast thou not to give to those who know that there is such a
thing as happiness!&nbsp; I speak not of philosophical
contentment, though pain has afforded them the strongest
conviction of it.</p>
<p>After our coffee and milk&mdash;for the mistress of the house
had been roused long before us by her hospitality&mdash;my
baggage was taken forward in a boat by my host, because the car
could not safely have been brought to the house.</p>
<p>The road at first was very rocky and troublesome, but our
driver was careful, and the horses accustomed to the frequent and
sudden acclivities and descents; so that, not apprehending any
danger, I played with my girl, whom I would not leave to
Marguerite&rsquo;s care, on account of her timidity.</p>
<p>Stopping at a little inn to bait the horses, I saw the first
countenance in Sweden that displeased me, though the man was
better dressed than any one who had as yet fallen in my
way.&nbsp; An altercation took place between him and my host, the
purport of which I could not guess, excepting that I was the
occasion of it, be it what it would.&nbsp; The sequel was his
leaving the house angrily; and I was immediately informed that he
was the custom-house officer.&nbsp; The professional had indeed
effaced the national character, for, living as he did within
these frank hospitable people, still only the exciseman appeared,
the counterpart of some I had met with in England and
France.&nbsp; I was unprovided with a passport, not having
entered any great town.&nbsp; At Gothenburg I knew I could
immediately obtain one, and only the trouble made me object to
the searching my trunks.&nbsp; He blustered for money; but the
lieutenant was determined to guard me, according to promise, from
imposition.</p>
<p>To avoid being interrogated at the town-gate, and obliged to
go in the rain to give an account of myself (merely a form)
before we could get the refreshment we stood in need of, he
requested us to descend&mdash;I might have said step&mdash;from
our car, and walk into town.</p>
<p>I expected to have found a tolerable inn, but was ushered into
a most comfortless one; and, because it was about five
o&rsquo;clock, three or four hours after their dining hour, I
could not prevail on them to give me anything warm to eat.</p>
<p>The appearance of the accommodations obliged me to deliver one
of my recommendatory letters, and the gentleman to whom it was
addressed sent to look out for a lodging for me whilst I partook
of his supper.&nbsp; As nothing passed at this supper to
characterise the country, I shall here close my letter.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Yours truly.</p>
<h2>LETTER II.</h2>
<p>Gothenburg is a clean airy town, and, having been built by the
Dutch, has canals running through each street; and in some of
them there are rows of trees that would render it very pleasant
were it not for the pavement, which is intolerably bad.</p>
<p>There are several rich commercial houses&mdash;Scotch, French,
and Swedish; but the Scotch, I believe, have been the most
successful.&nbsp; The commerce and commission business with
France since the war has been very lucrative, and enriched the
merchants I am afraid at the expense of the other inhabitants, by
raising the price of the necessaries of life.</p>
<p>As all the men of consequence&mdash;I mean men of the largest
fortune&mdash;are merchants, their principal enjoyment is a
relaxation from business at the table, which is spread at, I
think, too early an hour (between one and two) for men who have
letters to write and accounts to settle after paying due respect
to the bottle.</p>
<p>However, when numerous circles are to be brought together, and
when neither literature nor public amusements furnish topics for
conversation, a good dinner appears to be the only centre to
rally round, especially as scandal, the zest of more select
parties, can only be whispered.&nbsp; As for politics, I have
seldom found it a subject of continual discussion in a country
town in any part of the world.&nbsp; The politics of the place,
being on a smaller scale, suits better with the size of their
faculties; for, generally speaking, the sphere of observation
determines the extent of the mind.</p>
<p>The more I see of the world, the more I am convinced that
civilisation is a blessing not sufficiently estimated by those
who have not traced its progress; for it not only refines our
enjoyments, but produces a variety which enables us to retain the
primitive delicacy of our sensations.&nbsp; Without the aid of
the imagination all the pleasures of the senses must sink into
grossness, unless continual novelty serve as a substitute for the
imagination, which, being impossible, it was to this weariness, I
suppose, that Solomon alluded when he declared that there was
nothing new under the sun!&mdash;nothing for the common
sensations excited by the senses.&nbsp; Yet who will deny that
the imagination and understanding have made many, very many
discoveries since those days, which only seem harbingers of
others still more noble and beneficial?&nbsp; I never met with
much imagination amongst people who had not acquired a habit of
reflection; and in that state of society in which the judgment
and taste are not called forth, and formed by the cultivation of
the arts and sciences, little of that delicacy of feeling and
thinking is to be found characterised by the word
sentiment.&nbsp; The want of scientific pursuits perhaps accounts
for the hospitality, as well as for the cordial reception which
strangers receive from the inhabitants of small towns.</p>
<p>Hospitality has, I think, been too much praised by travellers
as a proof of goodness of heart, when, in my opinion,
indiscriminate hospitality is rather a criterion by which you may
form a tolerable estimate of the indolence or vacancy of a head;
or, in other words, a fondness for social pleasures in which the
mind not having its proportion of exercise, the bottle must be
pushed about.</p>
<p>These remarks are equally applicable to Dublin, the most
hospitable city I ever passed through.&nbsp; But I will try to
confine my observations more particularly to Sweden.</p>
<p>It is true I have only had a glance over a small part of it;
yet of its present state of manners and acquirements I think I
have formed a distinct idea, without having visited the
capital&mdash;where, in fact, less of a national character is to
be found than in the remote parts of the country.</p>
<p>The Swedes pique themselves on their politeness; but far from
being the polish of a cultivated mind, it consists merely of
tiresome forms and ceremonies.&nbsp; So far, indeed, from
entering immediately into your character, and making you feel
instantly at your ease, like the well-bred French, their
over-acted civility is a continual restraint on all your
actions.&nbsp; The sort of superiority which a fortune gives when
there is no superiority of education, excepting what consists in
the observance of senseless forms, has a contrary effect than
what is intended; so that I could not help reckoning the
peasantry the politest people of Sweden, who, only aiming at
pleasing you, never think of being admired for their
behaviour.</p>
<p>Their tables, like their compliments, seem equally a
caricature of the French.&nbsp; The dishes are composed, as well
as theirs, of a variety of mixtures to destroy the native taste
of the food without being as relishing.&nbsp; Spices and sugar
are put into everything, even into the bread; and the only way I
can account for their partiality to high-seasoned dishes is the
constant use of salted provisions.&nbsp; Necessity obliges them
to lay up a store of dried fish and salted meat for the winter;
and in summer, fresh meat and fish taste insipid after
them.&nbsp; To which may be added the constant use of
spirits.&nbsp; Every day, before dinner and supper, even whilst
the dishes are cooling on the table, men and women repair to a
side-table; and to obtain an appetite eat bread-and-butter,
cheese, raw salmon, or anchovies, drinking a glass of
brandy.&nbsp; Salt fish or meat then immediately follows, to give
a further whet to the stomach.&nbsp; As the dinner advances,
pardon me for taking up a few minutes to describe what, alas! has
detained me two or three hours on the stretch observing, dish
after dish is changed, in endless rotation, and handed round with
solemn pace to each guest; but should you happen not to like the
first dishes, which was often my case, it is a gross breach of
politeness to ask for part of any other till its turn
comes.&nbsp; But have patience, and there will be eating
enough.&nbsp; Allow me to run over the acts of a visiting day,
not overlooking the interludes.</p>
<p>Prelude a luncheon&mdash;then a succession of fish, flesh, and
fowl for two hours, during which time the dessert&mdash;I was
sorry for the strawberries and cream&mdash;rests on the table to
be impregnated by the fumes of the viands.&nbsp; Coffee
immediately follows in the drawing-room, but does not preclude
punch, ale, tea and cakes, raw salmon, &amp;c.&nbsp; A supper
brings up the rear, not forgetting the introductory luncheon,
almost equalling in removes the dinner.&nbsp; A day of this kind
you would imagine sufficient; but a to-morrow and a
to-morrow&mdash;A never-ending, still-beginning feast may be
bearable, perhaps, when stern winter frowns, shaking with
chilling aspect his hoary locks; but during a summer, sweet as
fleeting, let me, my kind strangers, escape sometimes into your
fir groves, wander on the margin of your beautiful lakes, or
climb your rocks, to view still others in endless perspective,
which, piled by more than giant&rsquo;s hand, scale the heavens
to intercept its rays, or to receive the parting tinge of
lingering day&mdash;day that, scarcely softened unto twilight,
allows the freshening breeze to wake, and the moon to burst forth
in all her glory to glide with solemn elegance through the azure
expanse.</p>
<p>The cow&rsquo;s bell has ceased to tinkle the herd to rest;
they have all paced across the heath.&nbsp; Is not this the
witching time of night?&nbsp; The waters murmur, and fall with
more than mortal music, and spirits of peace walk abroad to calm
the agitated breast.&nbsp; Eternity is in these moments.&nbsp;
Worldly cares melt into the airy stuff that dreams are made of,
and reveries, mild and enchanting as the first hopes of love or
the recollection of lost enjoyment, carry the hapless wight into
futurity, who in bustling life has vainly strove to throw off the
grief which lies heavy at the heart.&nbsp; Good night!&nbsp; A
crescent hangs out in the vault before, which woos me to stray
abroad.&nbsp; It is not a silvery reflection of the sun, but
glows with all its golden splendour.&nbsp; Who fears the fallen
dew?&nbsp; It only makes the mown grass smell more
fragrant.&nbsp; Adieu!</p>
<h2>LETTER III.</h2>
<p>The population of Sweden has been estimated from two millions
and a half to three millions; a small number for such an immense
tract of country, of which only so much is cultivated&mdash;and
that in the simplest manner&mdash;as is absolutely requisite to
supply the necessaries of life; and near the seashore, whence
herrings are easily procured, there scarcely appears a vestige of
cultivation.&nbsp; The scattered huts that stand shivering on the
naked rocks, braving the pitiless elements, are formed of logs of
wood rudely hewn; and so little pains are taken with the craggy
foundation that nothing hike a pathway points out the door.</p>
<p>Gathered into himself by the cold, lowering his visage to
avoid the cutting blast, is it surprising that the churlish
pleasure of drinking drams takes place of social enjoyments
amongst the poor, especially if we take into the account that
they mostly live on high-seasoned provision and rye bread?&nbsp;
Hard enough, you may imagine, as it is baked only once a
year.&nbsp; The servants also, in most families, eat this kind of
bread, and have a different kind of food from their masters,
which, in spite of all the arguments I have heard to vindicate
the custom, appears to me a remnant of barbarism.</p>
<p>In fact, the situation of the servants in every respect,
particularly that of the women, shows how far the Swedes are from
having a just conception of rational equality.&nbsp; They are not
termed slaves; yet a man may strike a man with impunity because
he pays him wages, though these wages are so low that necessity
must teach them to pilfer, whilst servility renders them false
and boorish.&nbsp; Still the men stand up for the dignity of man
by oppressing the women.&nbsp; The most menial, and even
laborious offices, are therefore left to these poor
drudges.&nbsp; Much of this I have seen.&nbsp; In the winter, I
am told, they take the linen down to the river to wash it in the
cold water, and though their hands, cut by the ice, are cracked
and bleeding, the men, their fellow-servants, will not disgrace
their manhood by carrying a tub to lighten their burden.</p>
<p>You will not be surprised to hear that they do not wear shoes
or stockings, when I inform you that their wages are seldom more
than twenty or thirty shillings per annum.&nbsp; It is the
custom, I know, to give them a new year&rsquo;s gift and a
present at some other period, but can it all amount to a just
indemnity for their labour?&nbsp; The treatment of servants in
most countries, I grant, is very unjust, and in England, that
boasted land of freedom, it is often extremely tyrannical.&nbsp;
I have frequently, with indignation, heard gentlemen declare that
they would never allow a servant to answer them; and ladies of
the most exquisite sensibility, who were continually exclaiming
against the cruelty of the vulgar to the brute creation, have in
my presence forgot that their attendants had human feelings as
well as forms.&nbsp; I do not know a more agreeable sight than to
see servants part of a family.&nbsp; By taking an interest,
generally speaking, in their concerns you inspire them with one
for yours.&nbsp; We must love our servants, or we shall never be
sufficiently attentive to their happiness; and how can those
masters be attentive to their happiness who, living above their
fortunes, are more anxious to outshine their neighbours than to
allow their household the innocent enjoyments they earn?</p>
<p>It is, in fact, much more difficult for servants, who are
tantalised by seeing and preparing the dainties of which they are
not to partake, to remain honest, than the poor, whose thoughts
are not led from their homely fare; so that, though the servants
here are commonly thieves, you seldom hear of housebreaking, or
robbery on the highway.&nbsp; The country is, perhaps, too thinly
inhabited to produce many of that description of thieves termed
footpads, or highwaymen.&nbsp; They are usually the spawn of
great cities&mdash;the effect of the spurious desires generated
by wealth, rather than the desperate struggles of poverty to
escape from misery.</p>
<p>The enjoyment of the peasantry was drinking brandy and coffee,
before the latter was prohibited, and the former not allowed to
be privately distilled, the wars carried on by the late king
rendering it necessary to increase the revenue, and retain the
specie in the country by every possible means.</p>
<p>The taxes before the reign of Charles XII. were
inconsiderable.&nbsp; Since then the burden has continually been
growing heavier, and the price of provisions has proportionately
increased&mdash;nay, the advantage accruing from the exportation
of corn to France and rye to Germany will probably produce a
scarcity in both Sweden and Norway, should not a peace put a stop
to it this autumn, for speculations of various kinds have already
almost doubled the price.</p>
<p>Such are the effects of war, that it saps the vitals even of
the neutral countries, who, obtaining a sudden influx of wealth,
appear to be rendered flourishing by the destruction which
ravages the hapless nations who are sacrificed to the ambition of
their governors.&nbsp; I shall not, however, dwell on the vices,
though they be of the most contemptible and embruting cast, to
which a sudden accession of fortune gives birth, because I
believe it may be delivered as an axiom, that it is only in
proportion to the industry necessary to acquire wealth that a
nation is really benefited by it.</p>
<p>The prohibition of drinking coffee under a penalty, and the
encouragement given to public distilleries, tend to impoverish
the poor, who are not affected by the sumptuary laws; for the
regent has lately laid very severe restraints on the articles of
dress, which the middling class of people found grievous, because
it obliged them to throw aside finery that might have lasted them
for their lives.</p>
<p>These may be termed vexatious; still the death of the king, by
saving them from the consequences his ambition would naturally
have entailed on them, may be reckoned a blessing.</p>
<p>Besides, the French Revolution has not only rendered all the
crowned heads more cautious, but has so decreased everywhere
(excepting amongst themselves) a respect for nobility, that the
peasantry have not only lost their blind reverence for their
seigniors, but complain in a manly style of oppressions which
before they did not think of denominating such, because they were
taught to consider themselves as a different order of
beings.&nbsp; And, perhaps, the efforts which the aristocrats are
making here, as well as in every other part of Europe, to secure
their sway, will be the most effectual mode of undermining it,
taking into the calculation that the King of Sweden, like most of
the potentates of Europe, has continually been augmenting his
power by encroaching on the privileges of the nobles.</p>
<p>The well-bred Swedes of the capital are formed on the ancient
French model, and they in general speak that language; for they
have a knack at acquiring languages with tolerable fluency.&nbsp;
This may be reckoned an advantage in some respects; but it
prevents the cultivation of their own, and any considerable
advance in literary pursuits.</p>
<p>A sensible writer has lately observed (I have not his work by
me, therefore cannot quote his exact words), &ldquo;That the
Americans very wisely let the Europeans make their books and
fashions for them.&rdquo;&nbsp; But I cannot coincide with him in
this opinion.&nbsp; The reflection necessary to produce a certain
number even of tolerable productions augments more than he is
aware of the mass of knowledge in the community.&nbsp; Desultory
reading is commonly a mere pastime.&nbsp; But we must have an
object to refer our reflections to, or they will seldom go below
the surface.&nbsp; As in travelling, the keeping of a journal
excites to many useful inquiries that would not have been thought
of had the traveller only determined to see all he could see,
without ever asking himself for what purpose.&nbsp; Besides, the
very dabbling in literature furnishes harmless topics of
conversation; for the not having such subjects at hand, though
they are often insupportably fatiguing, renders the inhabitants
of little towns prying and censorious.&nbsp; Idleness, rather
than ill-nature, gives birth to scandal, and to the observation
of little incidents which narrows the mind.&nbsp; It is
frequently only the fear of being talked of which produces that
puerile scrupulosity about trifles incompatible with an enlarged
plan of usefulness, and with the basis of all moral
principles&mdash;respect for the virtues which are not merely the
virtues of convention.</p>
<p>I am, my friend, more and more convinced that a metropolis, or
an abode absolutely solitary, is the best calculated for the
improvement of the heart, as well as the understanding; whether
we desire to become acquainted with man, nature, or
ourselves.&nbsp; Mixing with mankind, we are obliged to examine
our prejudices, and often imperceptibly lose, as we analyse
them.&nbsp; And in the country, growing intimate with nature, a
thousand little circumstances, unseen by vulgar eyes, give birth
to sentiments dear to the imagination, and inquiries which expand
the soul, particularly when cultivation has not smoothed into
insipidity all its originality of character.</p>
<p>I love the country, yet whenever I see a picturesque situation
chosen on which to erect a dwelling I am always afraid of the
improvements.&nbsp; It requires uncommon taste to form a whole,
and to introduce accommodations and ornaments analogous with the
surrounding-scene.</p>
<p>It visited, near Gothenburg, a house with improved land about
it, with which I was particularly delighted.&nbsp; It was close
to a lake embosomed in pine-clad rocks.&nbsp; In one part of the
meadows your eye was directed to the broad expanse, in another
you were led into a shade, to see a part of it, in the form of a
river, rush amongst the fragments of rocks and roots of trees;
nothing seemed forced.&nbsp; One recess, particularly grand and
solemn amongst the towering cliffs, had a rude stone table and
seat placed in it, that might have served for a Druid&rsquo;s
haunt, whilst a placid stream below enlivened the flowers on its
margin, where light-footed elves would gladly have danced their
airy rounds.</p>
<p>Here the hand of taste was conspicuous though not obtrusive,
and formed a contrast with another abode in the same
neighbourhood, on which much money had been lavished; where
Italian colonnades were placed to excite the wonder of the rude
crags, and a stone staircase, to threaten with destruction a
wooden house.&nbsp; Venuses and Apollos condemned to lie hid in
snow three parts of the year seemed equally displaced, and called
the attention off from the surrounding sublimity, without
inspiring any voluptuous sensations.&nbsp; Yet even these
abortions of vanity have been useful.&nbsp; Numberless workmen
have been employed, and the superintending artist has improved
the labourers, whose unskilfulness tormented him, by obliging
them to submit to the discipline of rules.&nbsp; Adieu!</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Yours affectionately.</p>
<h2>LETTER IV.</h2>
<p>The severity of the long Swedish winter tends to render the
people sluggish, for though this season has its peculiar
pleasures, too much time is employed to guard against its
inclemency.&nbsp; Still as warm clothing is absolutely necessary,
the women spin and the men weave, and by these exertions get a
fence to keep out the cold.&nbsp; I have rarely passed a knot of
cottages without seeing cloth laid out to bleach, and when I
entered, always found the women spinning or knitting.</p>
<p>A mistaken tenderness, however, for their children, makes them
even in summer load them with flannels, and having a sort of
natural antipathy to cold water, the squalid appearance of the
poor babes, not to speak of the noxious smell which flannel and
rugs retain, seems a reply to a question I had often
asked&mdash;Why I did not see more children in the villages I
passed through?&nbsp; Indeed the children appear to be nipt in
the bud, having neither the graces nor charms of their age.&nbsp;
And this, I am persuaded, is much more owing to the ignorance of
the mothers than to the rudeness of the climate.&nbsp; Rendered
feeble by the continual perspiration they are kept in, whilst
every pore is absorbing unwholesome moisture, they give them,
even at the breast, brandy, salt fish, and every other crude
substance which air and exercise enables the parent to
digest.</p>
<p>The women of fortune here, as well as everywhere else, have
nurses to suckle their children; and the total want of chastity
in the lower class of women frequently renders them very unfit
for the trust.</p>
<p>You have sometimes remarked to me the difference of the
manners of the country girls in England and in America;
attributing the reserve of the former to the climate&mdash;to the
absence of genial suns.&nbsp; But it must be their stars, not the
zephyrs, gently stealing on their senses, which here lead frail
women astray.&nbsp; Who can look at these rocks, and allow the
voluptuousness of nature to be an excuse for gratifying the
desires it inspires?&nbsp; We must therefore, find some other
cause beside voluptuousness, I believe, to account for the
conduct of the Swedish and American country girls; for I am led
to conclude, from all the observations I have made, that there is
always a mixture of sentiment and imagination in voluptuousness,
to which neither of them have much pretension.</p>
<p>The country girls of Ireland and Wales equally feel the first
impulse of nature, which, restrained in England by fear or
delicacy, proves that society is there in a more advanced
state.&nbsp; Besides, as the mind is cultivated, and taste gains
ground, the passions become stronger, and rest on something more
stable than the casual sympathies of the moment.&nbsp; Health and
idleness will always account for promiscuous amours; and in some
degree I term every person idle, the exercise of whose mind does
not bear some proportion to that of the body.</p>
<p>The Swedish ladies exercise neither sufficiently; of course,
grow very fat at an early age; and when they have not this downy
appearance, a comfortable idea, you will say, in a cold climate,
they are not remarkable for fine forms.&nbsp; They have, however,
mostly fine complexions; but indolence makes the lily soon
displace the rose.&nbsp; The quantity of coffee, spices, and
other things of that kind, with want of care, almost universally
spoil their teeth, which contrast but ill with their ruby
lips.</p>
<p>The manners of Stockholm are refined, I hear, by the
introduction of gallantry; but in the country, romping and coarse
freedoms, with coarser allusions, keep the spirits awake.&nbsp;
In the article of cleanliness, the women of all descriptions seem
very deficient; and their dress shows that vanity is more
inherent in women than taste.</p>
<p>The men appear to have paid still less court to the
graces.&nbsp; They are a robust, healthy race, distinguished for
their common sense and turn for humour, rather than for wit or
sentiment.&nbsp; I include not, as you may suppose, in this
general character, some of the nobility and officers, who having
travelled, are polite and well informed.</p>
<p>I must own to you that the lower class of people here amuse
and interest me much more than the middling, with their apish
good breeding and prejudices.&nbsp; The sympathy and frankness of
heart conspicuous in the peasantry produces even a simple
gracefulness of deportment which has frequently struck me as very
picturesque; I have often also been touched by their extreme
desire to oblige me, when I could not explain my wants, and by
their earnest manner of expressing that desire.&nbsp; There is
such a charm in tenderness!&nbsp; It is so delightful to love our
fellow-creatures, and meet the honest affections as they break
forth.&nbsp; Still, my good friend, I begin to think that I
should not like to live continually in the country with people
whose minds have such a narrow range.&nbsp; My heart would
frequently be interested; but my mind would languish for more
companionable society.</p>
<p>The beauties of nature appear to me now even more alluring
than in my youth, because my intercourse with the world has
formed without vitiating my taste.&nbsp; But, with respect to the
inhabitants of the country, my fancy has probably, when disgusted
with artificial manners, solaced itself by joining the advantages
of cultivation with the interesting sincerity of innocence,
forgetting the lassitude that ignorance will naturally
produce.&nbsp; I like to see animals sporting, and sympathise in
their pains and pleasures.&nbsp; Still I love sometimes to view
the human face divine, and trace the soul, as well as the heart,
in its varying lineaments.</p>
<p>A journey to the country, which I must shortly make, will

<p>Had I determined to travel in Sweden merely for pleasure, I
should probably have chosen the road to Stockholm, though
convinced, by repeated observation, that the manners of a people
are best discriminated in the country.&nbsp; The inhabitants of
the capital are all of the same genus; for the varieties in the
species we must, therefore, search where the habitations of men
are so separated as to allow the difference of climate to have
its natural effect.&nbsp; And with this difference we are,
perhaps, most forcibly struck at the first view, just as we form
an estimate of the leading traits of a character at the first
glance, of which intimacy afterwards makes us almost lose
sight.</p>
<p>As my affairs called me to Stromstad (the frontier town of
Sweden) in my way to Norway, I was to pass over, I heard, the
most uncultivated part of the country.&nbsp; Still I believe that
the grand features of Sweden are the same everywhere, and it is
only the grand features that admit of description.&nbsp; There is
an individuality in every prospect, which remains in the memory
as forcibly depicted as the particular features that have
arrested our attention; yet we cannot find words to discriminate
that individuality so as to enable a stranger to say, this is the
face, that the view.&nbsp; We may amuse by setting the
imagination to work; but we cannot store the memory with a
fact.</p>
<p>As I wish to give you a general idea of this country, I shall
continue in my desultory manner to make such observations and
reflections as the circumstances draw forth, without losing time,
by endeavouring to arrange them.</p>
<p>Travelling in Sweden is very cheap, and even commodious, if
you make but the proper arrangements.&nbsp; Here, as in other
parts of the Continent, it is necessary to have your own
carriage, and to have a servant who can speak the language, if
you are unacquainted with it.&nbsp; Sometimes a servant who can
drive would be found very useful, which was our case, for I
travelled in company with two gentlemen, one of whom had a German
servant who drove very well.&nbsp; This was all the party; for
not intending to make a long stay, I left my little girl behind
me.</p>
<p>As the roads are not much frequented, to avoid waiting three
or four hours for horses, we sent, as is the constant custom, an
<i>avant courier</i> the night before, to order them at every
post, and we constantly found them ready.&nbsp; Our first set I
jokingly termed requisition horses; but afterwards we had almost
always little spirited animals that went on at a round pace.</p>
<p>The roads, making allowance for the ups and downs, are
uncommonly good and pleasant.&nbsp; The expense, including the
postillions and other incidental things, does not amount to more
than a shilling the Swedish mile.</p>
<p>The inns are tolerable; but not liking the rye bread, I found
it necessary to furnish myself with some wheaten before I set
out.&nbsp; The beds, too, were particularly disagreeable to
me.&nbsp; It seemed to me that I was sinking into a grave when I
entered them; for, immersed in down placed in a sort of box, I
expected to be suffocated before morning.&nbsp; The sleeping
between two down beds&mdash;they do so even in summer&mdash;must
be very unwholesome during any season; and I cannot conceive how
the people can bear it, especially as the summers are very
warm.&nbsp; But warmth they seem not to feel; and, I should
think, were afraid of the air, by always keeping their windows
shut.&nbsp; In the winter, I am persuaded, I could not exist in
rooms thus closed up, with stoves heated in their manner, for
they only put wood into them twice a day; and, when the stove is
thoroughly heated, they shut the flue, not admitting any air to
renew its elasticity, even when the rooms are crowded with
company.&nbsp; These stoves are made of earthenware, and often in
a form that ornaments an apartment, which is never the case with
the heavy iron ones I have seen elsewhere.&nbsp; Stoves may be
economical, but I like a fire, a wood one, in preference; and I
am convinced that the current of air which it attracts renders
this the best mode of warming rooms.</p>
<p>We arrived early the second evening at a little village called
Quistram, where we had determined to pass the night, having been
informed that we should not afterwards find a tolerable inn until
we reached Stromstad.</p>
<p>Advancing towards Quistram, as the sun was beginning to
decline, I was particularly impressed by the beauty of the
situation.&nbsp; The road was on the declivity of a rocky
mountain, slightly covered with a mossy herbage and vagrant
firs.&nbsp; At the bottom, a river, straggling amongst the
recesses of stone, was hastening forward to the ocean and its
grey rocks, of which we had a prospect on the left; whilst on the
right it stole peacefully forward into the meadows, losing itself
in a thickly-wooded rising ground.&nbsp; As we drew near, the
loveliest banks of wild flowers variegated the prospect, and
promised to exhale odours to add to the sweetness of the air, the
purity of which you could almost see, alas! not smell, for the
putrefying herrings, which they use as manure, after the oil has
been extracted, spread over the patches of earth, claimed by
cultivation, destroyed every other.</p>
<p>It was intolerable, and entered with us into the inn, which
was in other respects a charming retreat.</p>
<p>Whilst supper was preparing I crossed the bridge, and strolled
by the river, listening to its murmurs.&nbsp; Approaching the
bank, the beauty of which had attracted my attention in the
carriage, I recognised many of my old acquaintance growing with
great luxuriance.</p>
<p>Seated on it, I could not avoid noting an obvious
remark.&nbsp; Sweden appeared to me the country in the world most
proper to form the botanist and natural historian; every object
seemed to remind me of the creation of things, of the first
efforts of sportive nature.&nbsp; When a country arrives at a
certain state of perfection, it looks as if it were made so; and
curiosity is not excited.&nbsp; Besides, in social life too many
objects occur for any to be distinctly observed by the generality
of mankind; yet a contemplative man, or poet, in the
country&mdash;I do not mean the country adjacent to
cities&mdash;feels and sees what would escape vulgar eyes, and
draws suitable inferences.&nbsp; This train of reflections might
have led me further, in every sense of the word; but I could not
escape from the detestable evaporation of the herrings, which
poisoned all my pleasure.</p>
<p>After making a tolerable supper&mdash;for it is not easy to
get fresh provisions on the road&mdash;I retired, to be lulled to
sleep by the murmuring of a stream, of which I with great
difficulty obtained sufficient to perform my daily ablutions.</p>
<p>The last battle between the Danes and Swedes, which gave new
life to their ancient enmity, was fought at this place 1788; only
seventeen or eighteen were killed, for the great superiority of
the Danes and Norwegians obliged the Swedes to submit; but
sickness, and a scarcity of provision, proved very fatal to their
opponents on their return.</p>
<p>It would be very easy to search for the particulars of this
engagement in the publications of the day; but as this manner of
filling my pages does not come within my plan, I probably should
not have remarked that the battle was fought here, were it not to
relate an anecdote which I had from good authority.</p>
<p>I noticed, when I first mentioned this place to you, that we
descended a steep before we came to the inn; an immense ridge of
rocks stretching out on one side.&nbsp; The inn was sheltered
under them; and about a hundred yards from it was a bridge that
crossed the river, the murmurs of which I have celebrated; it was
not fordable.&nbsp; The Swedish general received orders to stop
at the bridge and dispute the passage&mdash;a most advantageous
post for an army so much inferior in force; but the influence of
beauty is not confined to courts.&nbsp; The mistress of the inn
was handsome; when I saw her there were still some remains of
beauty; and, to preserve her house, the general gave up the only
tenable station.&nbsp; He was afterwards broke for contempt of
orders.</p>
<p>Approaching the frontiers, consequently the sea, nature
resumed an aspect ruder and ruder, or rather seemed the bones of
the world waiting to be clothed with everything necessary to give
life and beauty.&nbsp; Still it was sublime.</p>
<p>The clouds caught their hue of the rocks that menaced
them.&nbsp; The sun appeared afraid to shine, the birds ceased to
sing, and the flowers to bloom; but the eagle fixed his nest high
amongst the rocks, and the vulture hovered over this abode of
desolation.&nbsp; The farm houses, in which only poverty resided,
were formed of logs scarcely keeping off the cold and drifting
snow: out of them the inhabitants seldom peeped, and the sports
or prattling of children was neither seen or heard.&nbsp; The
current of life seemed congealed at the source: all were not
frozen, for it was summer, you remember; but everything appeared
so dull that I waited to see ice, in order to reconcile me to the
absence of gaiety.</p>
<p>The day before, my attention had frequently been attracted by
the wild beauties of the country we passed through.</p>
<p>The rocks which tossed their fantastic heads so high were
often covered with pines and firs, varied in the most picturesque
manner.&nbsp; Little woods filled up the recesses when forests
did not darken the scene, and valleys and glens, cleared of the
trees, displayed a dazzling verdure which contrasted with the
gloom of the shading pines.&nbsp; The eye stole into many a
covert where tranquillity seemed to have taken up her abode, and
the number of little lakes that continually presented themselves
added to the peaceful composure of the scenery.&nbsp; The little
cultivation which appeared did not break the enchantment, nor did
castles rear their turrets aloft to crush the cottages, and prove
that man is more savage than the natives of the woods.&nbsp; I
heard of the bears but never saw them stalk forth, which I was
sorry for; I wished to have seen one in its wild state.&nbsp; In
the winter, I am told, they sometimes catch a stray cow, which is
a heavy loss to the owner.</p>
<p>The farms are small.&nbsp; Indeed most of the houses we saw on
the road indicated poverty, or rather that the people could just
live.&nbsp; Towards the frontiers they grew worse and worse in
their appearance, as if not willing to put sterility itself out
of countenance.&nbsp; No gardens smiled round the habitations,
not a potato or cabbage to eat with the fish drying on a stick
near the door.&nbsp; A little grain here and there appeared, the
long stalks of which you might almost reckon.&nbsp; The day was
gloomy when we passed over this rejected spot, the wind bleak,
and winter seemed to be contending with nature, faintly
struggling to change the season.&nbsp; Surely, thought I, if the
sun ever shines here it cannot warm these stones; moss only
cleaves to them, partaking of their hardness, and nothing like
vegetable life appears to cheer with hope the heart.</p>
<p>So far from thinking that the primitive inhabitants of the
world lived in a southern climate where Paradise spontaneously
arose, I am led to infer, from various circumstances, that the
first dwelling of man happened to be a spot like this which led
him to adore a sun so seldom seen; for this worship, which
probably preceded that of demons or demigods, certainly never
began in a southern climate, where the continual presence of the
sun prevented its being considered as a good; or rather the want
of it never being felt, this glorious luminary would carelessly
have diffused its blessings without being hailed as a
benefactor.&nbsp; Man must therefore have been placed in the
north, to tempt him to run after the sun, in order that the
different parts of the earth might be peopled.&nbsp; Nor do I
wonder that hordes of barbarians always poured out of these
regions to seek for milder climes, when nothing like cultivation
attached them to the soil, especially when we take into the view
that the adventuring spirit, common to man, is naturally stronger
and more general during the infancy of society.&nbsp; The conduct
of the followers of Mahomet, and the crusaders, will sufficiently
corroborate my assertion.</p>
<p>Approaching nearer to Stromstad, the appearance of the town
proved to be quite in character with the country we had just
passed through.&nbsp; I hesitated to use the word country, yet
could not find another; still it would sound absurd to talk of
fields of rocks.</p>
<p>The town was built on and under them.&nbsp; Three or four
weather-beaten trees were shrinking from the wind, and the grass
grew so sparingly that I could not avoid thinking Dr.
Johnson&rsquo;s hyperbolical assertion &ldquo;that the man
merited well of his country who made a few blades of grass grow
where they never grew before,&rdquo; might here have been uttered
with strict propriety.&nbsp; The steeple likewise towered aloft,
for what is a church, even amongst the Lutherans, without a
steeple?&nbsp; But to prevent mischief in such an exposed
situation, it is wisely placed on a rock at some distance not to
endanger the roof of the church.</p>
<p>Rambling about, I saw the door open, and entered, when to my
great surprise I found the clergyman reading prayers, with only
the clerk attending.&nbsp; I instantly thought of Swift&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Dearly beloved Roger,&rdquo; but on inquiry I learnt that
some one had died that morning, and in Sweden it is customary to
pray for the dead.</p>
<p>The sun, who I suspected never dared to shine, began now to
convince me that he came forth only to torment; for though the
wind was still cutting, the rocks became intolerably warm under
my feet, whilst the herring effluvia, which I before found so
very offensive, once more assailed me.&nbsp; I hastened back to
the house of a merchant, the little sovereign of the place,
because he was by far the richest, though not the mayor.</p>
<p>Here we were most hospitably received, and introduced to a
very fine and numerous family.&nbsp; I have before mentioned to
you the lilies of the north, I might have added, water lilies,
for the complexion of many, even of the young women, seem to be
bleached on the bosom of snow.&nbsp; But in this youthful circle
the roses bloomed with all their wonted freshness, and I wondered
from whence the fire was stolen which sparkled in their fine blue
eyes.</p>
<p>Here we slept; and I rose early in the morning to prepare for
my little voyage to Norway.&nbsp; I had determined to go by
water, and was to leave my companions behind; but not getting a
boat immediately, and the wind being high and unfavourable, I was
told that it was not safe to go to sea during such boisterous
weather; I was, therefore, obliged to wait for the morrow, and
had the present day on my hands, which I feared would be irksome,
because the family, who possessed about a dozen French words
amongst them and not an English phrase, were anxious to amuse me,
and would not let me remain alone in my room.&nbsp; The town we
had already walked round and round, and if we advanced farther on
the coast, it was still to view the same unvaried immensity of
water surrounded by barrenness.</p>
<p>The gentlemen, wishing to peep into Norway, proposed going to
Fredericshall, the first town&mdash;the distance was only three
Swedish miles.&nbsp; There and back again was but a day&rsquo;s
journey, and would not, I thought, interfere with my
voyage.&nbsp; I agreed, and invited the eldest and prettiest of
the girls to accompany us.&nbsp; I invited her because I like to
see a beautiful face animated by pleasure, and to have an
opportunity of regarding the country, whilst the gentlemen were
amusing themselves with her.</p>
<p>I did not know, for I had not thought of it, that we were to
scale some of the most mountainous cliffs of Sweden in our way to
the ferry which separates the two countries.</p>
<p>Entering amongst the cliffs, we were sheltered from the wind,
warm sunbeams began to play, streams to flow, and groves of pines
diversified the rocks.&nbsp; Sometimes they became suddenly bare
and sublime.&nbsp; Once, in particular, after mounting the most
terrific precipice, we had to pass through a tremendous defile,
where the closing chasm seemed to threaten us with instant
destruction, when, turning quickly, verdant meadows and a
beautiful lake relieved and charmed my eyes.</p>
<p>I had never travelled through Switzerland, but one of my
companions assured me that I should not there find anything
superior, if equal, to the wild grandeur of these views.</p>
<p>As we had not taken this excursion into our plan, the horses
had not been previously ordered, which obliged us to wait two
hours at the first post.&nbsp; The day was wearing away.&nbsp;
The road was so bad that walking up the precipices consumed the
time insensibly; but as we desired horses at each post ready at a
certain hour, we reckoned on returning more speedily.</p>
<p>We stopped to dine at a tolerable farm; they brought us out
ham, butter, cheese, and milk, and the charge was so moderate
that I scattered a little money amongst the children who were
peeping at us, in order to pay them for their trouble.</p>
<p>Arrived at the ferry, we were still detained, for the people
who attend at the ferries have a stupid kind of sluggishness in
their manner, which is very provoking when you are in
haste.&nbsp; At present I did not feel it, for, scrambling up the
cliffs, my eye followed the river as it rolled between the grand
rocky banks; and, to complete the scenery, they were covered with
firs and pines, through which the wind rustled as if it were
lulling itself to sleep with the declining sun.</p>
<p>Behold us now in Norway; and I could not avoid feeling
surprise at observing the difference in the manners of the
inhabitants of the two sides of the river, for everything shows
that the Norwegians are more industrious and more opulent.&nbsp;
The Swedes (for neighbours are seldom the best friends) accuse
the Norwegians of knavery, and they retaliate by bringing a
charge of hypocrisy against the Swedes.&nbsp; Local circumstances
probably render both unjust, speaking from their feelings rather
than reason; and is this astonishing when we consider that most
writers of travels have done the same, whose works have served as
materials for the compilers of universal histories?&nbsp; All are
eager to give a national character, which is rarely just, because
they do not discriminate the natural from the acquired
difference.&nbsp; The natural, I believe, on due consideration,
will be found to consist merely in the degree of vivacity, or
thoughtfulness, pleasures or pain, inspired by the climate,
whilst the varieties which the forms of government, including
religion, produce are much more numerous and unstable.</p>
<p>A people have been characterised as stupid by nature; what a
paradox! because they did not consider that slaves, having no
object to stimulate industry; have not their faculties sharpened
by the only thing that can exercise them, self-interest.&nbsp;
Others have been brought forward as brutes, having no aptitude
for the arts and sciences, only because the progress of
improvement had not reached that stage which produces them.</p>
<p>Those writers who have considered the history of man, or of
the human mind, on a more enlarged scale have fallen into similar
errors, not reflecting that the passions are weak where the
necessaries of life are too hardly or too easily obtained.</p>
<p>Travellers who require that every nation should resemble their
native country, had better stay at home.&nbsp; It is, for
example, absurd to blame a people for not having that degree of
personal cleanliness and elegance of manners which only
refinement of taste produces, and will produce everywhere in
proportion as society attains a general polish.&nbsp; The most
essential service, I presume, that authors could render to
society, would be to promote inquiry and discussion, instead of
making those dogmatical assertions which only appear calculated
to gird the human mind round with imaginary circles, like the
paper globe which represents the one he inhabits.</p>
<p>This spirit of inquiry is the characteristic of the present
century, from which the succeeding will, I am persuaded, receive
a great accumulation of knowledge; and doubtless its diffusion
will in a great measure destroy the factitious national
characters which have been supposed permanent, though only
rendered so by the permanency of ignorance.</p>
<p>Arriving at Fredericshall, at the siege of which Charles XII.
lost his life, we had only time to take a transient view of it
whilst they were preparing us some refreshment.</p>
<p>Poor Charles!&nbsp; I thought of him with respect.&nbsp; I
have always felt the same for Alexander, with whom he has been
classed as a madman by several writers, who have reasoned
superficially, confounding the morals of the day with the few
grand principles on which unchangeable morality rests.&nbsp;
Making no allowance for the ignorance and prejudices of the
period, they do not perceive how much they themselves are
indebted to general improvement for the acquirements, and even
the virtues, which they would not have had the force of mind to
attain by their individual exertions in a less advanced state of
society.</p>
<p>The evening was fine, as is usual at this season, and the
refreshing odour of the pine woods became more perceptible, for
it was nine o&rsquo;clock when we left Fredericshall.&nbsp; At
the ferry we were detained by a dispute relative to our Swedish
passport, which we did not think of getting countersigned in
Norway.&nbsp; Midnight was coming on, yet it might with such
propriety have been termed the noon of night that, had Young ever
travelled towards the north, I should not have wondered at his
becoming enamoured of the moon.&nbsp; But it is not the Queen of
Night alone who reigns here in all her splendour, though the sun,
loitering just below the horizon, decks her within a golden tinge
from his car, illuminating the cliffs that hide him; the heavens
also, of a clear softened blue, throw her forward, and the
evening star appears a smaller moon to the naked eye.&nbsp; The
huge shadows of the rocks, fringed with firs, concentrating the
views without darkening them, excited that tender melancholy
which, sublimating the imagination, exalts rather than depresses
the mind.</p>
<p>My companions fell asleep&mdash;fortunately they did not
snore; and I contemplated, fearless of idle questions, a night
such as I had never before seen or felt, to charm the senses, and
calm the heart.&nbsp; The very air was balmy as it freshened into
morn, producing the most voluptuous sensations.&nbsp; A vague
pleasurable sentiment absorbed me, as I opened my bosom to the
embraces of nature; and my soul rose to its Author, with the
chirping of the solitary birds, which began to feel, rather than
see, advancing day.&nbsp; I had leisure to mark its
progress.&nbsp; The grey morn, streaked with silvery rays,
ushered in the orient beams (how beautifully varying into
purple!), yet I was sorry to lose the soft watery clouds which
preceded them, exciting a kind of expectation that made me almost
afraid to breathe, lest I should break the charm.&nbsp; I saw the
sun&mdash;and sighed.</p>
<p>One of my companions, now awake, perceiving that the
postillion had mistaken the road, began to swear at him, and
roused the other two, who reluctantly shook off sleep.</p>
<p>We had immediately to measure back our steps, and did not
reach Stromstad before five in the morning.</p>
<p>The wind had changed in the night, and my boat was ready.</p>
<p>A dish of coffee, and fresh linen, recruited my spirits, and I
directly set out again for Norway, purposing to land much higher
up the coast.</p>
<p>Wrapping my great-coat round me, I lay down on some sails at
the bottom of the boat, its motion rocking me to rest, till a
discourteous wave interrupted my slumbers, and obliged me to rise
and feel a solitariness which was not so soothing as that of the
past night.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Adieu!</p>
<h2>LETTER VI.</h2>
<p>The sea was boisterous, but, as I had an experienced pilot, I
did not apprehend any danger.&nbsp; Sometimes, I was told, boats
are driven far out and lost.&nbsp; However, I seldom calculate
chances so nicely&mdash;sufficient for the day is the obvious
evil!</p>
<p>We had to steer amongst islands and huge rocks, rarely losing
sight of the shore, though it now and then appeared only a mist
that bordered the water&rsquo;s edge.&nbsp; The pilot assured me
that the numerous harbours on the Norway coast were very safe,
and the pilot-boats were always on the watch.&nbsp; The Swedish
side is very dangerous, I am also informed; and the help of
experience is not often at hand to enable strange vessels to
steer clear of the rocks, which lurk below the water close to the
shore.</p>
<p>There are no tides here, nor in the Cattegate, and, what
appeared to me a consequence, no sandy beach.&nbsp; Perhaps this
observation has been made before; but it did not occur to me till
I saw the waves continually beating against the bare rocks,
without ever receding to leave a sediment to harden.</p>
<p>The wind was fair, till we had to tack about in order to enter
Laurvig, where we arrived towards three o&rsquo;clock in the
afternoon.&nbsp; It is a clean, pleasant town, with a
considerable iron-work, which gives life to it.</p>
<p>As the Norwegians do not frequently see travellers, they are
very curious to know their business, and who they are&mdash;so
curious, that I was half tempted to adopt Dr. Franklin&rsquo;s
plan, when travelling in America, where they are equally prying,
which was to write on a paper, for public inspection, my name,
from whence I came, where I was going, and what was my
business.&nbsp; But if I were importuned by their curiosity,
their friendly gestures gratified me.&nbsp; A woman coming alone
interested them.&nbsp; And I know not whether my weariness gave
me a look of peculiar delicacy, but they approached to assist me,
and inquire after my wants, as if they were afraid to hurt, and
wished to protect me.&nbsp; The sympathy I inspired, thus
dropping down from the clouds in a strange land, affected me more
than it would have done had not my spirits been harassed by
various causes&mdash;by much thinking&mdash;musing almost to
madness&mdash;and even by a sort of weak melancholy that hung
about my heart at parting with my daughter for the first
time.</p>
<p>You know that, as a female, I am particularly attached to her;
I feel more than a mother&rsquo;s fondness and anxiety when I
reflect on the dependent and oppressed state of her sex.&nbsp; I
dread lest she should be forced to sacrifice her heart to her
principles, or principles to her heart.&nbsp; With trembling hand
I shall cultivate sensibility and cherish delicacy of sentiment,
lest, whilst I lend fresh blushes to the rose, I sharpen the
thorns that will wound the breast I would fain guard; I dread to
unfold her mind, lest it should render her unfit for the world
she is to inhabit.&nbsp; Hapless woman! what a fate is thine!</p>
<p>But whither am I wandering?&nbsp; I only meant to tell you
that the impression the kindness of the simple people made
visible on my countenance increased my sensibility to a painful
degree.&nbsp; I wished to have had a room to myself, for their
attention, and rather distressing observation, embarrassed me
extremely.&nbsp; Yet, as they would bring me eggs, and make my
coffee, I found I could not leave them without hurting their
feelings of hospitality.</p>
<p>It is customary here for the host and hostess to welcome their
guests as master and mistress of the house.</p>
<p>My clothes, in their turn, attracted the attention of the
females, and I could not help thinking of the foolish vanity
which makes many women so proud of the observation of strangers
as to take wonder very gratuitously for admiration.&nbsp; This
error they are very apt to fall into when, arrived in a foreign
country, the populace stare at them as they pass.&nbsp; Yet the
make of a cap or the singularity of a gown is often the cause of
the flattering attention which afterwards supports a fantastic
superstructure of self-conceit.</p>
<p>Not having brought a carriage over with me, expecting to have
met a person where I landed, who was immediately to have procured
me one, I was detained whilst the good people of the inn sent
round to all their acquaintance to search for a vehicle.&nbsp; A
rude sort of cabriole was at last found, and a driver half drunk,
who was not less eager to make a good bargain on that
account.&nbsp; I had a Danish captain of a ship and his mate with
me; the former was to ride on horseback, at which he was not very
expert, and the latter to partake of my seat.&nbsp; The driver
mounted behind to guide the horses and flourish the whip over our
shoulders; he would not suffer the reins out of his own
hands.&nbsp; There was something so grotesque in our appearance
that I could not avoid shrinking into myself when I saw a
gentleman-like man in the group which crowded round the door to
observe us.&nbsp; I could have broken the driver&rsquo;s whip for
cracking to call the women and children together, but seeing a
significant smile on the face, I had before remarked, I burst
into a laugh to allow him to do so too, and away we flew.&nbsp;
This is not a flourish of the pen, for we actually went on full
gallop a long time, the horses being very good; indeed, I have
never met with better, if so good, post-horses as in
Norway.&nbsp; They are of a stouter make than the English horses,
appear to be well fed, and are not easily tired.</p>
<p>I had to pass over, I was informed, the most fertile and best
cultivated tract of country in Norway.&nbsp; The distance was
three Norwegian miles, which are longer than the Swedish.&nbsp;
The roads were very good; the farmers are obliged to repair them;
and we scampered through a great extent of country in a more
improved state than any I had viewed since I left England.&nbsp;
Still there was sufficient of hills, dales, and rocks to prevent
the idea of a plain from entering the head, or even of such
scenery as England and France afford.&nbsp; The prospects were
also embellished by water, rivers, and lakes before the sea
proudly claimed my regard, and the road running frequently
through lofty groves rendered the landscapes beautiful, though
they were not so romantic as those I had lately seen with such
delight.</p>
<p>It was late when I reached Tonsberg, and I was glad to go to
bed at a decent inn.&nbsp; The next morning the 17th of July,
conversing with the gentleman with whom I had business to
transact, I found that I should be detained at Tonsberg three
weeks, and I lamented that I had not brought my child with
me.</p>
<p>The inn was quiet, and my room so pleasant, commanding a view
of the sea, confined by an amphitheatre of hanging woods, that I
wished to remain there, though no one in the house could speak
English or French.&nbsp; The mayor, my friend, however, sent a
young woman to me who spoke a little English, and she agreed to
call on me twice a day to receive my orders and translate them to
my hostess.</p>
<p>My not understanding the language was an excellent pretext for
dining alone, which I prevailed on them to let me do at a late
hour, for the early dinners in Sweden had entirely deranged my
day.&nbsp; I could not alter it there without disturbing the
economy of a family where I was as a visitor, necessity having
forced me to accept of an invitation from a private family, the
lodgings were so incommodious.</p>
<p>Amongst the Norwegians I had the arrangement of my own time,
and I determined to regulate it in such a manner that I might
enjoy as much of their sweet summer as I possibly could; short,
it is true, but &ldquo;passing sweet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I never endured a winter in this rude clime, consequently it
was not the contrast, but the real beauty of the season which
made the present summer appear to me the finest I had ever
seen.&nbsp; Sheltered from the north and eastern winds, nothing
can exceed the salubrity, the soft freshness of the western
gales.&nbsp; In the evening they also die away; the aspen leaves
tremble into stillness, and reposing nature seems to be warmed by
the moon, which here assumes a genial aspect.&nbsp; And if a
light shower has chanced to fall with the sun, the juniper, the
underwood of the forest, exhales a wild perfume, mixed with a
thousand nameless sweets that, soothing the heart, leave images
in the memory which the imagination will ever hold dear.</p>
<p>Nature is the nurse of sentiment, the true source of taste;
yet what misery, as well as rapture, is produced by a quick
perception of the beautiful and sublime when it is exercised in
observing animated nature, when every beauteous feeling and
emotion excites responsive sympathy, and the harmonised soul
sinks into melancholy or rises to ecstasy, just as the chords are
touched, like the &AElig;olian harp agitated by the changing
wind.&nbsp; But how dangerous is it to foster these sentiments in
such an imperfect state of existence, and how difficult to
eradicate them when an affection for mankind, a passion for an
individual, is but the unfolding of that love which embraces all
that is great and beautiful!</p>
<p>When a warm heart has received strong impressions, they are
not to be effaced.&nbsp; Emotions become sentiments, and the
imagination renders even transient sensations permanent by fondly
retracing them.&nbsp; I cannot, without a thrill of delight,
recollect views I have seen, which are not to be forgotten, nor
looks I have felt in every nerve, which I shall never more
meet.&nbsp; The grave has closed over a dear friend, the friend
of my youth.&nbsp; Still she is present with me, and I hear her
soft voice warbling as I stray over the heath.&nbsp; Fate has
separated me from another, the fire of whose eyes, tempered by
infantine tenderness, still warms my breast; even when gazing on
these tremendous cliffs sublime emotions absorb my soul.&nbsp;
And, smile not, if I add that the rosy tint of morning reminds me
of a suffusion which will never more charm my senses, unless it
reappears on the cheeks of my child.&nbsp; Her sweet blushes I
may yet hide in my bosom, and she is still too young to ask why
starts the tear so near akin to pleasure and pain.</p>
<p>I cannot write any more at present.&nbsp; To-morrow we will
talk of Tonsberg.</p>
<h2>LETTER VII.</h2>
<p>Though the king of Denmark be an absolute monarch, yet the
Norwegians appear to enjoy all the blessings of freedom.&nbsp;
Norway may be termed a sister kingdom; but the people have no
viceroy to lord it over them, and fatten his dependants with the
fruit of their labour.</p>
<p>There are only two counts in the whole country who have
estates, and exact some feudal observances from their
tenantry.&nbsp; All the rest of the country is divided into small
farms, which belong to the cultivator.&nbsp; It is true some few,
appertaining to the Church, are let, but always on a lease for
life, generally renewed in favour of the eldest son, who has this
advantage as well as a right to a double portion of the
property.&nbsp; But the value of the farm is estimated, and after
his portion is assigned to him he must be answerable for the
residue to the remaining part of the family.</p>
<p>Every farmer for ten years is obliged to attend annually about
twelve days to learn the military exercise, but it is always at a
small distance from his dwelling, and does not lead him into any
new habits of life.</p>
<p>There are about six thousand regulars also in garrison at
Christiania and Fredericshall, who are equally reserved, with the
militia, for the defence of their own country.&nbsp; So that when
the Prince Royal passed into Sweden in 1788, he was obliged to
request, not command, them to accompany him on this
expedition.</p>
<p>These corps are mostly composed of the sons of the cottagers,
who being labourers on the farms, are allowed a few acres to
cultivate for themselves.&nbsp; These men voluntarily enlist, but
it is only for a limited period (six years), at the expiration of
which they have the liberty of retiring.&nbsp; The pay is only
twopence a day and bread; still, considering the cheapness of the
country, it is more than sixpence in England.</p>
<p>The distribution of landed property into small farms produces
a degree of equality which I have seldom seen elsewhere; and the
rich being all merchants, who are obliged to divide their
personal fortune amongst their children, the boys always
receiving twice as much as the girls, property has met a chance
of accumulating till overgrowing wealth destroys the balance of
liberty.</p>
<p>You will be surprised to hear me talk of liberty; yet the
Norwegians appear to me to be the most free community I have ever
observed.</p>
<p>The mayor of each town or district, and the judges in the
country, exercise an authority almost patriarchal.&nbsp; They can
do much good, but little harm,&mdash;as every individual can
appeal from their judgment; and as they may always be forced to
give a reason for their conduct, it is generally regulated by
prudence.&nbsp; &ldquo;They have not time to learn to be
tyrants,&rdquo; said a gentleman to me, with whom I discussed the
subject.</p>
<p>The farmers not fearing to be turned out of their farms,
should they displease a man in power, and having no vote to be
commanded at an election for a mock representative, are a manly
race; for not being obliged to submit to any debasing tenure in
order to live, or advance themselves in the world, they act with
an independent spirit.&nbsp; I never yet have heard of anything
like domineering or oppression, excepting such as has arisen from
natural causes.&nbsp; The freedom the people enjoy may, perhaps,
render them a little litigious, and subject them to the
impositions of cunning practitioners of the law; but the
authority of office is bounded, and the emoluments of it do not
destroy its utility.</p>
<p>Last year a man who had abused his power was cashiered, on the
representation of the people to the bailiff of the district.</p>
<p>There are four in Norway who might with propriety be termed
sheriffs; and from their sentence an appeal, by either party, may
be made to Copenhagen.</p>
<p>Near most of the towns are commons, on which the cows of all
the inhabitants, indiscriminately, are allowed to graze.&nbsp;
The poor, to whom a cow is necessary, are almost supported by
it.&nbsp; Besides, to render living more easy, they all go out to
fish in their own boats, and fish is their principal food.</p>
<p>The lower class of people in the towns are in general sailors;
and the industrious have usually little ventures of their own
that serve to render the winter comfortable.</p>
<p>With respect to the country at large, the importation is
considerably in favour of Norway.</p>
<p>They are forbidden, at present, to export corn or rye on
account of the advanced price.</p>
<p>The restriction which most resembles the painful subordination
of Ireland, is that vessels, trading to the West Indies, are
obliged to pass by their own ports, and unload their cargoes at
Copenhagen, which they afterwards reship.&nbsp; The duty is
indeed inconsiderable, but the navigation being dangerous, they
run a double risk.</p>
<p>There is an excise on all articles of consumption brought to
the towns; but the officers are not strict, and it would be
reckoned invidious to enter a house to search, as in England.</p>
<p>The Norwegians appear to me a sensible, shrewd people, with
little scientific knowledge, and still less taste for literature;
but they are arriving at the epoch which precedes the
introduction of the arts and sciences.</p>
<p>Most of the towns are seaports, and seaports are not
favourable to improvement.&nbsp; The captains acquire a little
superficial knowledge by travelling, which their indefatigable
attention to the making of money prevents their digesting; and
the fortune that they thus laboriously acquire is spent, as it
usually is in towns of this description, in show and good
living.&nbsp; They love their country, but have not much public
spirit.&nbsp; Their exertions are, generally speaking, only for
their families, which, I conceive, will always be the case, till
politics, becoming a subject of discussion, enlarges the heart by
opening the understanding.&nbsp; The French Revolution will have
this effect.&nbsp; They sing, at present, with great glee, many
Republican songs, and seem earnestly to wish that the republic
may stand; yet they appear very much attached to their Prince
Royal, and, as far as rumour can give an idea of a character, he
appears to merit their attachment.&nbsp; When I am at Copenhagen,
I shall be able to ascertain on what foundation their good
opinion is built; at present I am only the echo of it.</p>
<p>In the year 1788 he travelled through Norway; and acts of
mercy gave dignity to the parade, and interest to the joy his
presence inspired.&nbsp; At this town he pardoned a girl
condemned to die for murdering an illegitimate child, a crime
seldom committed in this country.&nbsp; She is since married, and
become the careful mother of a family.&nbsp; This might be given
as an instance, that a desperate act is not always a proof of an
incorrigible depravity of character, the only plausible excuse
that has been brought forward to justify the infliction of
capital punishments.</p>
<p>I will relate two or three other anecdotes to you, for the
truth of which I will not vouch because the facts were not of
sufficient consequence for me to take much pains to ascertain
them; and, true or false, they evince that the people like to
make a kind of mistress of their prince.</p>
<p>An officer, mortally wounded at the ill-advised battle of
Quistram, desired to speak with the prince; and with his dying
breath, earnestly recommended to his care a young woman of
Christiania, to whom he was engaged.&nbsp; When the prince
returned there, a ball was given by the chief inhabitants: he
inquired whether this unfortunate girl was invited, and requested
that she might, though of the second class.&nbsp; The girl came;
she was pretty; and finding herself among her superiors,
bashfully sat down as near the door as possible, nobody taking
notice of her.&nbsp; Shortly after, the prince entering,
immediately inquired for her, and asked her to dance, to the
mortification of the rich dames.&nbsp; After it was over he
handed her to the top of the room, and placing himself by her,
spoke of the loss she had sustained, with tenderness, promising
to provide for anyone she should marry, as the story goes.&nbsp;
She is since married, and he has not forgotten his promise.</p>
<p>A little girl, during the same expedition, in Sweden, who
informed him that the logs of a bridge were out underneath, was
taken by his orders to Christiania, and put to school at his
expense.</p>
<p>Before I retail other beneficial effects of his journey, it is
necessary to inform you that the laws here are mild, and do not
punish capitally for any crime but murder, which seldom
occurs.&nbsp; Every other offence merely subjects the delinquent
to imprisonment and labour in the castle, or rather arsenal at
Christiania, and the fortress at Fredericshall.&nbsp; The first
and second conviction produces a sentence for a limited number of
years&mdash;two, three, five, or seven, proportioned to the
atrocity of the crime.&nbsp; After the third he is whipped,
branded in the forehead, and condemned to perpetual
slavery.&nbsp; This is the ordinary course of justice.&nbsp; For
some flagrant breaches of trust, or acts of wanton cruelty,
criminals have been condemned to slavery for life time first the
of conviction, but not frequently.&nbsp; The number of these
slaves do not, I am informed, amount to more than a hundred,
which is not considerable, compared with the population, upwards
of eight hundred thousand.&nbsp; Should I pass through
Christiania, on my return to Gothenburg, I shall probably have an
opportunity of learning other particulars.</p>
<p>There is also a House of Correction at Christiania for
trifling misdemeanours, where the women are confined to labour
and imprisonment even for life.&nbsp; The state of the prisoners
was represented to the prince, in consequence of which he visited
the arsenal and House of Correction.&nbsp; The slaves at the
arsenal were loaded with irons of a great weight; he ordered them
to be lightened as much as possible.</p>
<p>The people in the House of Correction were commanded not to
speak to him; but four women, condemned to remain there for life,
got into the passage, and fell at his feet.&nbsp; He granted them
a pardon; and inquiring respecting the treatment of the
prisoners, he was informed that they were frequently whipped
going in, and coming out, and for any fault, at the discretion of
the inspectors.&nbsp; This custom he humanely abolished, though
some of the principal inhabitants, whose situation in life had
raised them above the temptation of stealing, were of opinion
that these chastisements were necessary and wholesome.</p>
<p>In short, everything seems to announce that the prince really
cherishes the laudable ambition of fulfilling the duties of his
station.&nbsp; This ambition is cherished and directed by the
Count Bernstorff, the Prime Minister of Denmark, who is
universally celebrated for his abilities and virtue.&nbsp; The
happiness of the people is a substantial eulogium; and, from all
I can gather, the inhabitants of Denmark and Norway are the least
oppressed people of Europe.&nbsp; The press is free.&nbsp; They
translate any of the French publications of the day, deliver
their opinion on the subject, and discuss those it leads to with
great freedom, and without fearing to displease the
Government.</p>
<p>On the subject of religion they are likewise becoming
tolerant, at least, and perhaps have advanced a step further in
free-thinking.&nbsp; One writer has ventured to deny the divinity
of Jesus Christ, and to question the necessity or utility of the
Christian system, without being considered universally as a
monster, which would have been the case a few years ago.&nbsp;
They have translated many German works on education; and though
they have not adopted any of their plans, it has become a subject
of discussion.&nbsp; There are some grammar and free schools;
but, from what I hear, not very good ones.&nbsp; All the children
learn to read, write, and cast accounts, for the purposes of
common life.&nbsp; They have no university; and nothing that
deserves the name of science is taught; nor do individuals, by
pursuing any branch of knowledge, excite a degree of curiosity
which is the forerunner of improvement.&nbsp; Knowledge is not
absolutely necessary to enable a considerable portion of the
community to live; and, till it is, I fear it never becomes
general.</p>
<p>In this country, where minerals abound, there is not one
collection; and, in all probability, I venture a conjecture, the
want of mechanical and chemical knowledge renders the silver
mines unproductive, for the quantity of silver obtained every
year is not sufficient to defray the expenses.&nbsp; It has been
urged that the employment of such a number of hands is very
beneficial.&nbsp; But a positive loss is never to be done away;
and the men, thus employed, would naturally find some other means
of living, instead of being thus a dead weight on Government, or
rather on the community from whom its revenue is drawn.</p>
<p>About three English miles from Tonsberg there is a salt work,
belonging, like all their establishments, to Government, in which
they employ above a hundred and fifty men, and maintain nearly
five hundred people, who earn their living.&nbsp; The clear
profit, an increasing one, amounts to two thousand pounds
sterling.&nbsp; And as the eldest son of the inspector, an
ingenious young man, has been sent by the Government to travel,
and acquire some mathematical and chemical knowledge in Germany,
it has a chance of being improved.&nbsp; He is the only person I
have met with here who appears to have a scientific turn of
mind.&nbsp; I do not mean to assert that I have not met with
others who have a spirit of inquiry.</p>
<p>The salt-works at St. Ubes are basins in the sand, and the sun
produces the evaporation, but here there is no beach.&nbsp;
Besides, the heat of summer is so short-lived that it would be
idle to contrive machines for such an inconsiderable portion of
the year.&nbsp; They therefore always use fires; and the whole
establishment appears to be regulated with judgment.</p>
<p>The situation is well chosen and beautiful.&nbsp; I do not
find, from the observation of a person who has resided here for
forty years, that the sea advances or recedes on this coast.</p>
<p>I have already remarked that little attention is paid to
education, excepting reading, writing, and the rudiments of
arithmetic; I ought to have added that a catechism is carefully
taught, and the children obliged to read in the churches, before
the congregation, to prove that they are not neglected.</p>
<p>Degrees, to enable any one to practise any profession, must be
taken at Copenhagen; and the people of this country, having the
good sense to perceive that men who are to live in a community
should at least acquire the elements of their knowledge, and form
their youthful attachments there, are seriously endeavouring to
establish a university in Norway.&nbsp; And Tonsberg, as a
central place in the best part of the country, had the most
suffrages, for, experiencing the bad effects of a metropolis,
they have determined not to have it in or near Christiania.&nbsp;
Should such an establishment take place, it will promote inquiry
throughout the country, and give a new face to society.&nbsp;
Premiums have been offered, and prize questions written, which I
am told have merit.&nbsp; The building college-halls, and other
appendages of the seat of science, might enable Tonsberg to
recover its pristine consequence, for it is one of the most
ancient towns of Norway, and once contained nine churches.&nbsp;
At present there are only two.&nbsp; One is a very old structure,
and has a Gothic respectability about it, which scarcely amounts
to grandeur, because, to render a Gothic pile grand, it must have
a huge unwieldiness of appearance.&nbsp; The chapel of Windsor
may be an exception to this rule; I mean before it was in its
present nice, clean state.&nbsp; When I first saw it, the pillars
within had acquired, by time, a sombre hue, which accorded with
the architecture; and the gloom increased its dimensions to the
eye by hiding its parts; but now it all bursts on the view at
once, and the sublimity has vanished before the brush and broom;
for it has been white-washed and scraped till it has become as
bright and neat as the pots and pans in a notable
house-wife&rsquo;s kitchen&mdash;yes; the very spurs on the
recumbent knights were deprived of their venerable rust, to give
a striking proof that a love of order in trifles, and taste for
proportion and arrangement, are very distinct.&nbsp; The glare of
light thus introduced entirely destroys the sentiment these piles
are calculated to inspire; so that, when I heard something like a
jig from the organ-loft, I thought it an excellent hall for
dancing or feasting.&nbsp; The measured pace of thought with
which I had entered the cathedral changed into a trip; and I
bounded on the terrace, to see the royal family, with a number of
ridiculous images in my head that I shall not now recall.</p>
<p>The Norwegians are fond of music, and every little church has
an organ.&nbsp; In the church I have mentioned there is an
inscription importing that a king James VI. of Scotland and I. of
England, who came with more than princely gallantry to escort his
bride home&mdash;stood there, and heard divine service.</p>
<p>There is a little recess full of coffins, which contains
bodies embalmed long since&mdash;so long, that there is not even
a tradition to lead to a guess at their names.</p>
<p>A desire of preserving the body seems to have prevailed in
most countries of the world, futile as it is to term it a
preservation, when the noblest parts are immediately sacrificed
merely to save the muscles, skin, and bone from rottenness.&nbsp;
When I was shown these human petrifactions, I shrank back with
disgust and horror.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ashes to ashes!&rdquo; thought
I&mdash;&ldquo;Dust to dust!&rdquo;&nbsp; If this be not
dissolution, it is something worse than natural decay&mdash;it is
treason against humanity, thus to lift up the awful veil which
would fain hide its weakness.&nbsp; The grandeur of the active
principle is never more strongly felt than at such a sight, for
nothing is so ugly as the human form when deprived of life, and
thus dried into stone, merely to preserve the most disgusting
image of death.&nbsp; The contemplation of noble ruins produces a
melancholy that exalts the mind.&nbsp; We take a retrospect of
the exertions of man, the fate of empires and their rulers, and
marking the grand destruction of ages, it seems the necessary
change of the leading to improvement.&nbsp; Our very soul
expands, and we forget our littleness&mdash;how painfully brought
to our recollection by such vain attempts to snatch from decay
what is destined so soon to perish.&nbsp; Life, what art
thou?&nbsp; Where goes this breath?&mdash;this <i>I</i>, so much
alive?&nbsp; In what element will it mix, giving or receiving
fresh energy?&nbsp; What will break the enchantment of
animation?&nbsp; For worlds I would not see a form I
loved&mdash;embalmed in my heart&mdash;thus sacrilegiously
handled?&nbsp; Pugh! my stomach turns.&nbsp; Is this all the
distinction of the rich in the grave?&nbsp; They had better
quietly allow the scythe of equality to mow them down with the
common mass, than struggle to become a monument of the
instability of human greatness.</p>
<p>The teeth, nails, and skin were whole, without appearing black
like the Egyptian mummies; and some silk, in which they had been
wrapped, still preserved its colour&mdash;pink&mdash;with
tolerable freshness.</p>
<p>I could not learn how long the bodies had been in this state,
in which they bid fair to remain till the Day of Judgment, if
there is to be such a day; and before that time, it will require
some trouble to make them fit to appear in company with angels
without disgracing humanity.&nbsp; God bless you!&nbsp; I feel a
conviction that we have some perfectible principle in our present
vestment, which will not be destroyed just as we begin to be
sensible of improvement; and I care not what habit it next puts
on, sure that it will be wisely formed to suit a higher state of
existence.&nbsp; Thinking of death makes us tenderly cling to our
affections; with more than usual tenderness I therefore assure
you that I am yours, wishing that the temporary death of absence
may not endure longer than is absolutely necessary.</p>
<h2>LETTER VIII.</h2>
<p>Tonsberg was formerly the residence of one of the little
sovereigns of Norway; and on an adjacent mountain the vestiges of
a fort remain, which was battered down by the Swedes, the
entrance of the bay lying close to it.</p>
<p>Here I have frequently strayed, sovereign of the waste; I
seldom met any human creature; and sometimes, reclining on the
mossy down, under the shelter of a rock, the prattling of the sea
amongst the pebbles has lulled me to sleep&mdash;no fear of any
rude satyr&rsquo;s approaching to interrupt my repose.&nbsp;
Balmy were the slumbers, and soft the gales, that refreshed me,
when I awoke to follow, with an eye vaguely curious, the white
sails, as they turned the cliffs, or seemed to take shelter under
the pines which covered the little islands that so gracefully
rose to render the terrific ocean beautiful.&nbsp; The fishermen
were calmly casting their nets, whilst the sea-gulls hovered over
the unruffled deep.&nbsp; Everything seemed to harmonise into
tranquillity; even the mournful call of the bittern was in
cadence with the tinkling bells on the necks of the cows, that,
pacing slowly one after the other, along an inviting path in the
vale below, were repairing to the cottages to be milked.&nbsp;
With what ineffable pleasure have I not gazed&mdash;and gazed
again, losing my breath through my eyes&mdash;my very soul
diffused itself in the scene; and, seeming to become all senses,
glided in the scarcely-agitated waves, melted in the freshening
breeze, or, taking its flight with fairy wing, to the misty
mountain which bounded the prospect, fancy tripped over new
lawns, more beautiful even than the lovely slopes on the winding
shore before me.&nbsp; I pause, again breathless, to trace, with
renewed delight, sentiments which entranced me, when, turning my
humid eyes from the expanse below to the vault above, my sight
pierced the fleecy clouds that softened the azure brightness; and
imperceptibly recalling the reveries of childhood, I bowed before
the awful throne of my Creator, whilst I rested on its
footstool.</p>
<p>You have sometimes wondered, my dear friend, at the extreme
affection of my nature.&nbsp; But such is the temperature of my
soul.&nbsp; It is not the vivacity of youth, the heyday of
existence.&nbsp; For years have I endeavoured to calm an
impetuous tide, labouring to make my feelings take an orderly
course.&nbsp; It was striving against the stream.&nbsp; I must
love and admire with warmth, or I sink into sadness.&nbsp; Tokens
of love which I have received have wrapped me in Elysium,
purifying the heart they enchanted.&nbsp; My bosom still
glows.&nbsp; Do not saucily ask, repeating Sterne&rsquo;s
question, &ldquo;Maria, is it still so warm?&rdquo;&nbsp;
Sufficiently, O my God!&nbsp; Has it been chilled by sorrow and
unkindness; still nature will prevail; and if I blush at
recollecting past enjoyment, it is the rosy hue of pleasure
heightened by modesty, for the blush of modesty and shame are as
distinct as the emotions by which they are produced.</p>
<p>I need scarcely inform you, after telling you of my walks,
that my constitution has been renovated here, and that I have
recovered my activity even whilst attaining a little
<i>embonpoint</i>.&nbsp; My imprudence last winter, and some
untoward accidents just at the time I was weaning my child, had
reduced me to a state of weakness which I never before
experienced.&nbsp; A slow fever preyed on me every night during
my residence in Sweden, and after I arrived at Tonsberg.&nbsp; By
chance I found a fine rivulet filtered through the rocks, and
confined in a basin for the cattle.&nbsp; It tasted to me like a
chalybeate; at any rate, it was pure; and the good effect of the
various waters which invalids are sent to drink depends, I
believe, more on the air, exercise, and change of scene, than on
their medicinal qualities.&nbsp; I therefore determined to turn
my morning walks towards it, and seek for health from the nymph
of the fountain, partaking of the beverage offered to the tenants
of the shade.</p>
<p>Chance likewise led me to discover a new pleasure equally
beneficial to my health.&nbsp; I wished to avail myself of my
vicinity to the sea and bathe; but it was not possible near the
town; there was no convenience.&nbsp; The young woman whom I
mentioned to you proposed rowing me across the water amongst the
rocks; but as she was pregnant, I insisted on taking one of the
oars, and learning to row.&nbsp; It was not difficult, and I do
not know a pleasanter exercise.&nbsp; I soon became expert, and
my train of thinking kept time, as it were, with the oars, or I
suffered the boat to be carried along by the current, indulging a
pleasing forgetfulness or fallacious hopes.&nbsp; How fallacious!
yet, without hope, what is to sustain life, but the fear of
annihilation&mdash;the only thing of which I have ever felt a
dread.&nbsp; I cannot bear to think of being no more&mdash;of
losing myself&mdash;though existence is often but a painful
consciousness of misery; nay, it appears to me impossible that I
should cease to exist, or that this active, restless spirit,
equally alive to joy and sorrow, should only be organised
dust&mdash;ready to fly abroad the moment the spring snaps, or
the spark goes out which kept it together.&nbsp; Surely something
resides in this heart that is not perishable, and life is more
than a dream.</p>
<p>Sometimes, to take up my oar once more, when the sea was calm,
I was amused by disturbing the innumerable young star fish which
floated just below the surface; I had never observed them before,
for they have not a hard shell like those which I have seen on
the seashore.&nbsp; They look like thickened water with a white
edge, and four purple circles, of different forms, were in the
middle, over an incredible number of fibres or white lines.&nbsp;
Touching them, the cloudy substance would turn or close, first on
one side, then on the other, very gracefully, but when I took one
of them up in the ladle, with which I heaved the water out of the
boat, it appeared only a colourless jelly.</p>
<p>I did not see any of the seals, numbers of which followed our
boat when we landed in Sweden; but though I like to sport in the
water I should have had no desire to join in their gambols.</p>
<p>Enough, you will say, of inanimate nature and of brutes, to
use the lordly phrase of man; let me hear something of the
inhabitants.</p>
<p>The gentleman with whom I had business is the Mayor of
Tonsberg.&nbsp; He speaks English intelligibly, and, having a
sound understanding, I was sorry that his numerous occupations
prevented my gaining as much information from him as I could have
drawn forth had we frequently conversed.&nbsp; The people of the
town, as far as I had an opportunity of knowing their sentiments,
are extremely well satisfied with his manner of discharging his
office.&nbsp; He has a degree of information and good sense which
excites respect, whilst a cheerfulness, almost amounting to
gaiety, enables him to reconcile differences and keep his
neighbours in good humour.&nbsp; &ldquo;I lost my horse,&rdquo;
said a woman to me, &ldquo;but ever since, when I want to send to
the mill, or go out, the Mayor lends me one.&nbsp; He scolds if I
do not come for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A criminal was branded, during my stay here, for the third
offence; but the relief he received made him declare that the
judge was one of the best men in the world.</p>
<p>I sent this wretch a trifle, at different times, to take with
him into slavery.&nbsp; As it was more than he expected, he
wished very much to see me, and this wish brought to my
remembrance an anecdote I heard when I was in Lisbon.</p>
<p>A wretch who had been imprisoned several years, during which
period lamps had been put up, was at last condemned to a cruel
death, yet, in his way to execution, he only wished for one
night&rsquo;s respite to see the city lighted.</p>
<p>Having dined in company at the mayor&rsquo;s I was invited
with his family to spend the day at one of the richest
merchant&rsquo;s houses.&nbsp; Though I could not speak Danish I
knew that I could see a great deal; yes, I am persuaded that I
have formed a very just opinion of the character of the
Norwegians, without being able to hold converse with them.</p>
<p>I had expected to meet some company, yet was a little
disconcerted at being ushered into an apartment full of well
dressed people, and glancing my eyes round they rested on several
very pretty faces.&nbsp; Rosy cheeks, sparkling eyes, and light
brown or golden locks; for I never saw so much hair with a yellow
cast, and, with their fine complexions, it looked very
becoming.</p>
<p>These women seem a mixture of indolence and vivacity; they
scarcely ever walk out, and were astonished that I should for
pleasure, yet they are immoderately fond of dancing.&nbsp;
Unaffected in their manners, if they have no pretensions to
elegance, simplicity often produces a gracefulness of deportment,
when they are animated by a particular desire to please, which
was the case at present.&nbsp; The solitariness of my situation,
which they thought terrible, interested them very much in my
favour.&nbsp; They gathered round me, sung to me, and one of the
prettiest, to whom I gave my hand with some degree of cordiality,
to meet the glance of her eyes, kissed me very
affectionately.</p>
<p>At dinner, which was conducted with great hospitality, though
we remained at table too long, they sung several songs, and,
amongst the rest, translations of some patriotic French
ones.&nbsp; As the evening advanced they became playful, and we
kept up a sort of conversation of gestures.&nbsp; As their minds
were totally uncultivated I did not lose much, perhaps gained, by
not being able to understand them; for fancy probably filled up,
more to their advantage, the void in the picture.&nbsp; Be that
as it may, they excited my sympathy, and I was very much
flattered when I was told the next day that they said it was a
pleasure to look at me, I appeared so good-natured.</p>
<p>The men were generally captains of ships.&nbsp; Several spoke
English very tolerably, but they were merely matter-of-fact men,
confined to a very narrow circle of observation.&nbsp; I found it
difficult to obtain from them any information respecting their
own country, when the fumes of tobacco did not keep me at a
distance.</p>
<p>I was invited to partake of some other feasts, and always had
to complain of the quantity of provision and the length of time
taken to consume it; for it would not have been proper to have
said devour, all went on so fair and softly.&nbsp; The servants
wait as slowly as their mistresses carve.</p>
<p>The young women here, as well as in Sweden, have commonly bad
teeth, which I attribute to the same causes.&nbsp; They are fond
of finery, but do not pay the necessary attention to their
persons, to render beauty less transient than a flower, and that
interesting expression which sentiment and accomplishments give
seldom supplies its place.</p>
<p>The servants have, likewise, an inferior sort of food here,
but their masters are not allowed to strike them with
impunity.&nbsp; I might have added mistresses, for it was a
complaint of this kind brought before the mayor which led me to a
knowledge of the fact.</p>
<p>The wages are low, which is particularly unjust, because the
price of clothes is much higher than that of provision.&nbsp; A
young woman, who is wet nurse to the mistress of the inn where I
lodge, receives only twelve dollars a year, and pays ten for the
nursing of her own child.&nbsp; The father had run away to get
clear of the expense.&nbsp; There was something in this most
painful state of widowhood which excited my compassion and led me
to reflections on the instability of the most flattering plans of
happiness, that were painful in the extreme, till I was ready to
ask whether this world was not created to exhibit every possible
combination of wretchedness.&nbsp; I asked these questions of a
heart writhing with anguish, whilst I listened to a melancholy
ditty sung by this poor girl.&nbsp; It was too early for thee to
be abandoned, thought I, and I hastened out of the house to take
my solitary evening&rsquo;s walk.&nbsp; And here I am again to
talk of anything but the pangs arising from the discovery of
estranged affection and the lonely sadness of a deserted
heart.</p>
<p>The father and mother, if the father can be ascertained, are
obliged to maintain an illegitimate child at their joint expense;
but, should the father disappear, go up the country or to sea,
the mother must maintain it herself.&nbsp; However, accidents of
this kind do not prevent their marrying, and then it is not
unusual to take the child or children home, and they are brought
up very amicably with the marriage progeny.</p>
<p>I took some pains to learn what books were written originally
in their language; but for any certain information respecting the
state of Danish literature I must wait till I arrive at
Copenhagen.</p>
<p>The sound of the language is soft, a great proportion of the
words ending in vowels; and there is a simplicity in the turn of
some of the phrases which have been translated to me that pleased
and interested me.&nbsp; In the country the farmers use the
<i>thou</i> and <i>thee</i>; and they do not acquire the polite
plurals of the towns by meeting at market.&nbsp; The not having
markets established in the large towns appears to me a great
inconvenience.&nbsp; When the farmers have anything to sell they
bring it to the neighbouring town and take it from house to
house.&nbsp; I am surprised that the inhabitants do not feel how
very incommodious this usage is to both parties, and redress it;
they, indeed, perceive it, for when I have introduced the subject
they acknowledged that they were often in want of necessaries,
there being no butchers, and they were often obliged to buy what
they did not want; yet it was the custom, and the changing of
customs of a long standing requires more energy than they yet
possess.&nbsp; I received a similar reply when I attempted to
persuade the women that they injured their children by keeping
them too warm.&nbsp; The only way of parrying off my reasoning
was that they must do as other people did; in short, reason on
any subject of change, and they stop you by saying that
&ldquo;the town would talk.&rdquo;&nbsp; A person of sense, with
a large fortune to ensure respect, might be very useful here, by
inducing them to treat their children and manage their sick
properly, and eat food dressed in a simpler manner&mdash;the
example, for instance, of a count&rsquo;s lady.</p>
<p>Reflecting on these prejudices made me revert to the wisdom of
those legislators who established institutions for the good of
the body under the pretext of serving heaven for the salvation of
the soul.&nbsp; These might with strict propriety be termed pious
frauds; and I admire the Peruvian pair for asserting that they
came from the sun, when their conduct proved that they meant to
enlighten a benighted country, whose obedience, or even
attention, could only be secured by awe.&nbsp; Thus much for
conquering the <i>inertia</i> of reason; but, when it is once in
motion, fables once held sacred may be ridiculed; and sacred they
were when useful to mankind.&nbsp; Prometheus alone stole fire to
animate the first man; his posterity needs not supernatural aid
to preserve the species, though love is generally termed a flame;
and it may not be necessary much longer to suppose men inspired
by heaven to inculcate the duties which demand special grace when
reason convinces them that they are the happiest who are the most
nobly employed.</p>
<p>In a few days I am to set out for the western part of Norway,
and then shall return by land to Gothenburg.&nbsp; I cannot think
of leaving this place without regret.&nbsp; I speak of the place
before the inhabitants, though there is a tenderness in their
artless kindness which attaches me to them; but it is an
attachment that inspires a regret very different from that I felt
at leaving Hull in my way to Sweden.&nbsp; The domestic happiness
and good-humoured gaiety of the amiable family where I and my
Frances were so hospitably received would have been sufficient to
ensure the tenderest remembrance, without the recollection of the
social evening to stimulate it, when good breeding gave dignity
to sympathy and wit zest to reason.</p>
<p>Adieu!&mdash;I am just informed that my horse has been waiting
this quarter of an hour.&nbsp; I now venture to ride out
alone.&nbsp; The steeple serves as a landmark.&nbsp; I once or
twice lost my way, walking alone, without being able to inquire
after a path; I was therefore obliged to make to the steeple, or
windmill, over hedge and ditch.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Yours truly.</p>
<h2>LETTER IX.</h2>
<p>I have already informed you that there are only two noblemen
who have estates of any magnitude in Norway.&nbsp; One of these
has a house near Tonsberg, at which he has not resided for some
years, having been at court, or on embassies.&nbsp; He is now the
Danish Ambassador in London.&nbsp; The house is pleasantly
situated, and the grounds about it fine; but their neglected
appearance plainly tells that there is nobody at home.</p>
<p>A stupid kind of sadness, to my eye, always reigns in a huge
habitation where only servants live to put cases on the furniture
and open the windows.&nbsp; I enter as I would into the tomb of
the Capulets, to look at the family pictures that here frown in
armour, or smile in ermine.&nbsp; The mildew respects not the
lordly robe, and the worm riots unchecked on the cheek of
beauty.</p>
<p>There was nothing in the architecture of the building, or the
form of the furniture, to detain me from the avenue where the
aged pines stretched along majestically.&nbsp; Time had given a
greyish cast to their ever-green foliage; and they stood, like
sires of the forest, sheltered on all sides by a rising
progeny.&nbsp; I had not ever seen so many oaks together in
Norway as in these woods, nor such large aspens as here were
agitated by the breeze, rendering the wind audible&mdash;nay
musical; for melody seemed on the wing around me.&nbsp; How
different was the fresh odour that reanimated me in the avenue,
from the damp chillness of the apartments; and as little did the
gloomy thoughtfulness excited by the dusty hangings, and
worm-eaten pictures, resemble the reveries inspired by the
soothing melancholy of their shade.&nbsp; In the winter, these
august pines, towering above the snow, must relieve the eye
beyond measure and give life to the white waste.</p>
<p>The continual recurrence of pine and fir groves in the day
sometimes wearies the sight, but in the evening, nothing can be
more picturesque, or, more properly speaking, better calculated
to produce poetical images.&nbsp; Passing through them, I have
been struck with a mystic kind of reverence, and I did, as it
were, homage to their venerable shadows.&nbsp; Not nymphs, but
philosophers, seemed to inhabit them&mdash;ever musing; I could
scarcely conceive that they were without some consciousness of
existence&mdash;without a calm enjoyment of the pleasure they
diffused.</p>
<p>How often do my feelings produce ideas that remind me of the
origin of many poetical fictions.&nbsp; In solitude, the
imagination bodies forth its conceptions unrestrained, and stops
enraptured to adore the beings of its own creation.&nbsp; These
are moments of bliss; and the memory recalls them with
delight.</p>
<p>But I have almost forgotten the matters of fact I meant to
relate, respecting the counts.&nbsp; They have the presentation
of the livings on their estates, appoint the judges, and
different civil officers, the Crown reserving to itself the
privilege of sanctioning them.&nbsp; But though they appoint,
they cannot dismiss.&nbsp; Their tenants also occupy their farms
for life, and are obliged to obey any summons to work on the part
he reserves for himself; but they are paid for their
labour.&nbsp; In short, I have seldom heard of any noblemen so
innoxious.</p>
<p>Observing that the gardens round the count&rsquo;s estate were
better cultivated than any I had before seen, I was led to
reflect on the advantages which naturally accrue from the feudal
tenures.&nbsp; The tenants of the count are obliged to work at a
stated price, in his grounds and garden; and the instruction
which they imperceptibly receive from the head gardener tends to
render them useful, and makes them, in the common course of
things, better husbandmen and gardeners on their own little
farms.&nbsp; Thus the great, who alone travel in this period of
society, for the observation of manners and customs made by
sailors is very confined, bring home improvement to promote their
own comfort, which is gradually spread abroad amongst the people,
till they are stimulated to think for themselves.</p>
<p>The bishops have not large revenues, and the priests are
appointed by the king before they come to them to be
ordained.&nbsp; There is commonly some little farm annexed to the
parsonage, and the inhabitants subscribe voluntarily, three times
a year, in addition to the church fees, for the support of the
clergyman.&nbsp; The church lands were seized when Lutheranism
was introduced, the desire of obtaining them being probably the
real stimulus of reformation.&nbsp; The tithes, which are never
required in kind, are divided into three parts&mdash;one to the
king, another to the incumbent, and the third to repair the
dilapidations of the parsonage.&nbsp; They do not amount to
much.&nbsp; And the stipend allowed to the different civil
officers is also too small, scarcely deserving to be termed an
independence; that of the custom-house officers is not sufficient
to procure the necessaries of life&mdash;no wonder, then, if
necessity leads them to knavery.&nbsp; Much public virtue cannot
be expected till every employment, putting perquisites out of the
question, has a salary sufficient to reward
industry;&mdash;whilst none are so great as to permit the
possessor to remain idle.&nbsp; It is this want of proportion
between profit and labour which debases men, producing the
sycophantic appellations of patron and client, and that
pernicious <i>esprit du corps</i>, proverbially vicious.</p>
<p>The farmers are hospitable as well as independent.&nbsp;
Offering once to pay for some coffee I drank when taking shelter
from the rain, I was asked, rather angrily, if a little coffee
was worth paying for.&nbsp; They smoke, and drink drams, but not
so much as formerly.&nbsp; Drunkenness, often the attendant
disgrace of hospitality, will here, as well as everywhere else,
give place to gallantry and refinement of manners; but the change
will not be suddenly produced.</p>
<p>The people of every class are constant in their attendance at
church; they are very fond of dancing, and the Sunday evenings in
Norway, as in Catholic countries, are spent in exercises which
exhilarate the spirits without vitiating the heart.&nbsp; The
rest of labour ought to be gay; and the gladness I have felt in
France on a Sunday, or Decadi, which I caught from the faces
around me, was a sentiment more truly religious than all the
stupid stillness which the streets of London ever inspired where
the Sabbath is so decorously observed.&nbsp; I recollect, in the
country parts of England, the churchwardens used to go out during
the service to see if they could catch any luckless wight playing
at bowls or skittles; yet what could be more harmless?&nbsp; It
would even, I think, be a great advantage to the English, if
feats of activity (I do not include boxing matches) were
encouraged on a Sunday, as it might stop the progress of
Methodism, and of that fanatical spirit which appears to be
gaining ground.&nbsp; I was surprised when I visited Yorkshire,
on my way to Sweden, to find that sullen narrowness of thinking
had made such a progress since I was an inhabitant of the
country.&nbsp; I could hardly have supposed that sixteen or
seventeen years could have produced such an alteration for the
worse in the morals of a place&mdash;yes, I say morals; for
observance of forms, and avoiding of practices, indifferent in
themselves, often supply the place of that regular attention to
duties which are so natural, that they seldom are vauntingly
exercised, though they are worth all the precepts of the law and
the prophets.&nbsp; Besides, many of these deluded people, with
the best meaning, actually lose their reason, and become
miserable, the dread of damnation throwing them into a state
which merits the term; and still more, in running after their
preachers, expecting to promote their salvation, they disregard
their welfare in this world, and neglect the interest and comfort
of their families; so that, in proportion as they attain a
reputation for piety, they become idle.</p>
<p>Aristocracy and fanaticism seem equally to be gaining ground
in England, particularly in the place I have mentioned; I saw
very little of either in Norway.&nbsp; The people are regular in
their attendance on public worship, but religion does not
interfere with their employments.</p>
<p>As the farmers cut away the wood they clear the ground.&nbsp;
Every year, therefore, the country is becoming fitter to support
the inhabitants.&nbsp; Half a century ago the Dutch, I am told,
only paid for the cutting down of the wood, and the farmers were
glad to get rid of it without giving themselves any
trouble.&nbsp; At present they form a just estimate of its value;
nay, I was surprised to find even firewood so dear when it
appears to be in such plenty.&nbsp; The destruction, or gradual
reduction, of their forests will probably ameliorate the climate,
and their manners will naturally improve in the same ratio as
industry requires ingenuity.&nbsp; It is very fortunate that men
are a long time but just above the brute creation, or the greater
part of the earth would never have been rendered habitable,
because it is the patient labour of men, who are only seeking for
a subsistence, which produces whatever embellishes existence,
affording leisure for the cultivation of the arts and sciences
that lift man so far above his first state.&nbsp; I never, my
friend, thought so deeply of the advantages obtained by human
industry as since I have been in Norway.&nbsp; The world
requires, I see, the hand of man to perfect it, and as this task
naturally unfolds the faculties he exercises, it is physically
impossible that he should have remained in Rousseau&rsquo;s
golden age of stupidity.&nbsp; And, considering the question of
human happiness, where, oh where does it reside?&nbsp; Has it
taken up its abode with unconscious ignorance or with the
high-wrought mind?&nbsp; Is it the offspring of thoughtless
animal spirits or the dye of fancy continually flitting round the
expected pleasure?</p>
<p>The increasing population of the earth must necessarily tend
to its improvement, as the means of existence are multiplied by
invention.</p>
<p>You have probably made similar reflections in America, where
the face of the country, I suppose, resembles the wilds of
Norway.&nbsp; I am delighted with the romantic views I daily
contemplate, animated by the purest air; and I am interested by
the simplicity of manners which reigns around me.&nbsp; Still
nothing so soon wearies out the feelings as unmarked
simplicity.&nbsp; I am therefore half convinced that I could not
live very comfortably exiled from the countries where mankind are
so much further advanced in knowledge, imperfect as it is, and
unsatisfactory to the thinking mind.&nbsp; Even now I begin to
long to hear what you are doing in England and France.&nbsp; My
thoughts fly from this wilderness to the polished circles of the
world, till recollecting its vices and follies, I bury myself in
the woods, but find it necessary to emerge again, that I may not
lose sight of the wisdom and virtue which exalts my nature.</p>
<p>What a long time it requires to know ourselves; and yet almost
every one has more of this knowledge than he is willing to own,
even to himself.&nbsp; I cannot immediately determine whether I
ought to rejoice at having turned over in this solitude a new
page in the history of my own heart, though I may venture to
assure you that a further acquaintance with mankind only tends to
increase my respect for your judgment and esteem for your
character.&nbsp; Farewell!</p>
<h2>LETTER X.</h2>
<p>I have once more, my friend, taken flight, for I left Tonsberg
yesterday, but with an intention of returning in my way back to
Sweden.</p>
<p>The road to Laurvig is very fine, and the country the best
cultivated in Norway.&nbsp; I never before admired the beech
tree, and when I met stragglers here they pleased me still
less.&nbsp; Long and lank, they would have forced me to allow
that the line of beauty requires some curves, if the stately
pine, standing near, erect, throwing her vast arms around, had
not looked beautiful in opposition to such narrow rules.</p>
<p>In these respects my very reason obliges me to permit my
feelings to be my criterion.&nbsp; Whatever excites emotion has
charms for me, though I insist that the cultivation of the mind
by warming, nay, almost creating the imagination, produces taste
and an immense variety of sensations and emotions, partaking of
the exquisite pleasure inspired by beauty and sublimity.&nbsp; As
I know of no end to them, the word infinite, so often misapplied,
might on this occasion be introduced with something like
propriety.</p>
<p>But I have rambled away again.&nbsp; I intended to have
remarked to you the effect produced by a grove of towering beech,
the airy lightness of their foliage admitting a degree of
sunshine, which, giving a transparency to the leaves, exhibited
an appearance of freshness and elegance that I had never before
remarked.&nbsp; I thought of descriptions of Italian
scenery.&nbsp; But these evanescent graces seemed the effect of
enchantment; and I imperceptibly breathed softly, lest I should
destroy what was real, yet looked so like the creation of
fancy.&nbsp; Dryden&rsquo;s fable of the flower and the leaf was
not a more poetical reverie.</p>
<p>Adieu, however, to fancy, and to all the sentiments which
ennoble our nature.&nbsp; I arrived at Laurvig, and found myself
in the midst of a group of lawyers of different
descriptions.&nbsp; My head turned round, my heart grew sick, as
I regarded visages deformed by vice, and listened to accounts of
chicanery that was continually embroiling the ignorant.&nbsp;
These locusts will probably diminish as the people become more
enlightened.&nbsp; In this period of social life the commonalty
are always cunningly attentive to their own interest; but their
faculties, confined to a few objects, are so narrowed, that they
cannot discover it in the general good.&nbsp; The profession of
the law renders a set of men still shrewder and more selfish than
the rest; and it is these men, whose wits have been sharpened by
knavery, who here undermine morality, confounding right and
wrong.</p>
<p>The Count of Bernstorff, who really appears to me, from all I
can gather, to have the good of the people at heart, aware of
this, has lately sent to the mayor of each district to name,
according to the size of the place, four or six of the
best-informed inhabitants, not men of the law, out of which the
citizens were to elect two, who are to be termed mediators.&nbsp;
Their office is to endeavour to prevent litigious suits, and
conciliate differences.&nbsp; And no suit is to be commenced
before the parties have discussed the dispute at their weekly
meeting.&nbsp; If a reconciliation should, in consequence, take
place, it is to be registered, and the parties are not allowed to
retract.</p>
<p>By these means ignorant people will be prevented from applying
for advice to men who may justly be termed stirrers-up of
strife.&nbsp; They have for a long time, to use a significant
vulgarism, set the people by the ears, and live by the spoil they
caught up in the scramble.&nbsp; There is some reason to hope
that this regulation will diminish their number, and restrain
their mischievous activity.&nbsp; But till trials by jury are
established, little justice can be expected in Norway.&nbsp;
Judges who cannot be bribed are often timid, and afraid of
offending bold knaves, lest they should raise a set of hornets
about themselves.&nbsp; The fear of censure undermines all energy
of character; and, labouring to be prudent, they lose sight of
rectitude.&nbsp; Besides, nothing is left to their conscience, or
sagacity; they must be governed by evidence, though internally
convinced that it is false.</p>
<p>There is a considerable iron manufactory at Laurvig for coarse
work, and a lake near the town supplies the water necessary for
working several mills belonging to it.</p>
<p>This establishment belongs to the Count of Laurvig.&nbsp;
Without a fortune and influence equal to his, such a work could
not have been set afloat; personal fortunes are not yet
sufficient to support such undertakings.&nbsp; Nevertheless the
inhabitants of the town speak of the size of his estate as an
evil, because it obstructs commerce.&nbsp; The occupiers of small
farms are obliged to bring their wood to the neighbouring
seaports to be shipped; but he, wishing to increase the value of
his, will not allow it to be thus gradually cut down, which turns
the trade into another channel.&nbsp; Added to this, nature is
against them, the bay being open and insecure.&nbsp; I could not
help smiling when I was informed that in a hard gale a vessel had
been wrecked in the main street.&nbsp; When there are such a
number of excellent harbours on the coast, it is a pity that
accident has made one of the largest towns grow up on a bad
one.</p>
<p>The father of the present count was a distant relation of the
family; he resided constantly in Denmark, and his son follows his
example.&nbsp; They have not been in possession of the estate
many years; and their predecessor lived near the town,
introducing a degree of profligacy of manners which has been
ruinous to the inhabitants in every respect, their fortunes not
being equal to the prevailing extravagance.</p>
<p>What little I have seen of the manners of the people does not
please me so well as those of Tonsberg.&nbsp; I am forewarned
that I shall find them still more cunning and fraudulent as I
advance towards the westward, in proportion as traffic takes
place of agriculture, for their towns are built on naked rocks,
the streets are narrow bridges, and the inhabitants are all
seafaring men, or owners of ships, who keep shops.</p>
<p>The inn I was at in Laurvig this journey was not the same that
I was at before.&nbsp; It is a good one&mdash;the people civil,
and the accommodations decent.&nbsp; They seem to be better
provided in Sweden; but in justice I ought to add that they
charge more extravagantly.&nbsp; My bill at Tonsberg was also
much higher than I had paid in Sweden, and much higher than it
ought to have been where provision is so cheap.&nbsp; Indeed,
they seem to consider foreigners as strangers whom they shall
never see again, and may fairly pluck.&nbsp; And the inhabitants
of the western coast, isolated, as it were, regard those of the
east almost as strangers.&nbsp; Each town in that quarter seems
to be a great family, suspicious of every other, allowing none to
cheat them but themselves; and, right or wrong, they support one
another in the face of justice.</p>
<p>On this journey I was fortunate enough to have one companion
with more enlarged views than the generality of his countrymen,
who spoke English tolerably.</p>
<p>I was informed that we might still advance a mile and a
quarter in our cabrioles; afterwards there was no choice, but of
a single horse and wretched path, or a boat, the usual mode of
travelling.</p>
<p>We therefore sent our baggage forward in the boat, and
followed rather slowly, for the road was rocky and sandy.&nbsp;
We passed, however, through several beech groves, which still
delighted me by the freshness of their light green foliage, and
the elegance of their assemblage, forming retreats to veil
without obscuring the sun.</p>
<p>I was surprised, at approaching the water, to find a little
cluster of houses pleasantly situated, and an excellent
inn.&nbsp; I could have wished to have remained there all night;
but as the wind was fair, and the evening fine, I was afraid to
trust to the wind&mdash;the uncertain wind of to-morrow.&nbsp; We
therefore left Helgeraac immediately with the declining sun.</p>
<p>Though we were in the open sea, we sailed more amongst the
rocks and islands than in my passage from Stromstad; and they
often forced very picturesque combinations.&nbsp; Few of the high
ridges were entirely bare; the seeds of some pines or firs had
been wafted by the winds or waves, and they stood to brave the
elements.</p>
<p>Sitting, then, in a little boat on the ocean, amidst
strangers, with sorrow and care pressing hard on
me&mdash;buffeting me about from clime to clime&mdash;I felt</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Like the lone shrub at random cast,<br />
That sighs and trembles at each blast!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On some of the largest rocks there were actually groves, the
retreat of foxes and hares, which, I suppose, had tripped over
the ice during the winter, without thinking to regain the main
land before the thaw.</p>
<p>Several of the islands were inhabited by pilots; and the
Norwegian pilots are allowed to be the best in the
world&mdash;perfectly acquainted with their coast, and ever at
hand to observe the first signal or sail.&nbsp; They pay a small
tax to the king and to the regulating officer, and enjoy the
fruit of their indefatigable industry.</p>
<p>One of the islands, called Virgin Land, is a flat, with some
depth of earth, extending for half a Norwegian mile, with three
farms on it, tolerably well cultivated.</p>
<p>On some of the bare rocks I saw straggling houses; they rose
above the denomination of huts inhabited by fishermen.&nbsp; My
companions assured me that they were very comfortable dwellings,
and that they have not only the necessaries, but even what might
be reckoned the superfluities of life.&nbsp; It was too late for
me to go on shore, if you will allow me to give that name to
shivering rocks, to ascertain the fact.</p>
<p>But rain coming on, and the night growing dark, the pilot
declared that it would be dangerous for us to attempt to go to
the place of our destination&mdash;East Rusoer&mdash;a Norwegian
mile and a half further; and we determined to stop for the night
at a little haven, some half dozen houses scattered under the
curve of a rock.&nbsp; Though it became darker and darker, our
pilot avoided the blind rocks with great dexterity.</p>
<p>It was about ten o&rsquo;clock when we arrived, and the old
hostess quickly prepared me a comfortable bed&mdash;a little too
soft or so, but I was weary; and opening the window to admit the
sweetest of breezes to fan me to sleep, I sunk into the most
luxurious rest: it was more than refreshing.&nbsp; The hospitable
sprites of the grots surely hovered round my pillow; and, if I
awoke, it was to listen to the melodious whispering of the wind
amongst them, or to feel the mild breath of morn.&nbsp; Light
slumbers produced dreams, where Paradise was before me.&nbsp; My
little cherub was again hiding her face in my bosom.&nbsp; I
heard her sweet cooing beat on my heart from the cliffs, and saw
her tiny footsteps on the sands.&nbsp; New-born hopes seemed,
like the rainbow, to appear in the clouds of sorrow, faint, yet
sufficient to amuse away despair.</p>
<p>Some refreshing but heavy showers have detained us; and here I
am writing quite alone&mdash;something more than gay, for which I
want a name.</p>
<p>I could almost fancy myself in Nootka Sound, or on some of the
islands on the north-west coast of America.&nbsp; We entered by a
narrow pass through the rocks, which from this abode appear more
romantic than you can well imagine; and seal-skins hanging at the
door to dry add to the illusion.</p>
<p>It is indeed a corner of the world, but you would be surprised
to see the cleanliness and comfort of the dwelling.&nbsp; The
shelves are not only shining with pewter and queen&rsquo;s ware,
but some articles in silver, more ponderous, it is true, than
elegant.&nbsp; The linen is good, as well as white.&nbsp; All the
females spin, and there is a loom in the kitchen.&nbsp; A sort of
individual taste appeared in the arrangement of the furniture
(this is not the place for imitation) and a kindness in their
desire to oblige.&nbsp; How superior to the apish politeness of
the towns! where the people, affecting to be well bred, fatigue
with their endless ceremony.</p>
<p>The mistress is a widow, her daughter is married to a pilot,
and has three cows.&nbsp; They have a little patch of land at
about the distance of two English miles, where they make hay for
the winter, which they bring home in a boat.&nbsp; They live here
very cheap, getting money from the vessels which stress of
weather, or other causes, bring into their harbour.&nbsp; I
suspect, by their furniture, that they smuggle a little.&nbsp; I
can now credit the account of the other houses, which I last
night thought exaggerated.</p>
<p>I have been conversing with one of my companions respecting
the laws and regulations of Norway.&nbsp; He is a man within
great portion of common sense and heart&mdash;yes, a warm
heart.&nbsp; This is not the first time I have remarked heart
without sentiment; they are distinct.&nbsp; The former depends on
the rectitude of the feelings, on truth of sympathy; these
characters have more tenderness than passion; the latter has a
higher source&mdash;call it imagination, genius, or what you
will, it is something very different.&nbsp; I have been laughing
with these simple worthy folk&mdash;to give you one of my
half-score Danish words&mdash;and letting as much of my heart
flow out in sympathy as they can take.&nbsp; Adieu!&nbsp; I must
trip up the rocks.&nbsp; The rain is ever.&nbsp; Let me catch
pleasure on the wing&mdash;I may be melancholy to-morrow.&nbsp;
Now all my nerves keep time with the melody of nature.&nbsp; Ah!
let me be happy whilst I can.&nbsp; The tear starts as I think of
it.&nbsp; I must flee from thought, and find refuge from sorrow
in a strong imagination&mdash;the only solace for a feeling
heart.&nbsp; Phantoms of bliss! ideal forms of excellence! again
enclose me in your magic circle, and wipe clear from my
remembrance the disappointments that reader the sympathy painful,
which experience rather increases than damps, by giving the
indulgence of feeling the sanction of reason.</p>
<p>Once more farewell!</p>
<h2>LETTER XI.</h2>
<p>I left Portoer, the little haven I mentioned, soon after I
finished my last letter.&nbsp; The sea was rough, and I perceived
that our pilot was right not to venture farther during a hazy
night.&nbsp; We had agreed to pay four dollars for a boat from
Helgeraac.&nbsp; I mention the sum, because they would demand
twice as much from a stranger.&nbsp; I was obliged to pay fifteen
for the one I hired at Stromstad.&nbsp; When we were ready to set
out, our boatman offered to return a dollar and let us go in one
of the boats of the place, the pilot who lived there being better
acquainted with the coast.&nbsp; He only demanded a dollar and a
half, which was reasonable.&nbsp; I found him a civil and rather
intelligent man; he was in the American service several years,
during the Revolution.</p>
<p>I soon perceived that an experienced mariner was necessary to
guide us, for we were continually obliged to tack about, to avoid
the rocks, which, scarcely reaching to the surface of the water,
could only be discovered by the breaking of the waves over
them.</p>
<p>The view of this wild coast, as we sailed along it, afforded
me a continual subject for meditation.&nbsp; I anticipated the
future improvement of the world, and observed how much man has
still to do to obtain of the earth all it could yield.&nbsp; I
even carried my speculations so far as to advance a million or
two of years to the moment when the earth would perhaps be so
perfectly cultivated, and so completely peopled, as to render it
necessary to inhabit every spot&mdash;yes, these bleak
shores.&nbsp; Imagination went still farther, and pictured the
state of man when the earth could no longer support him.&nbsp;
Whither was he to flee from universal famine?&nbsp; Do not smile;
I really became distressed for these fellow creatures yet
unborn.&nbsp; The images fastened on me, and the world appeared a
vast prison.&nbsp; I was soon to be in a smaller one&mdash;for no
other name can I give to Rusoer.&nbsp; It would be difficult to
form an idea of the place, if you have never seen one of these
rocky coasts.</p>
<p>We were a considerable time entering amongst the islands,
before we saw about two hundred houses crowded together under a
very high rock&mdash;still higher appearing above.&nbsp; Talk not
of Bastilles!&nbsp; To be born here was to be bastilled by
nature&mdash;shut out from all that opens the understanding, or
enlarges the heart.&nbsp; Huddled one behind another, not more
than a quarter of the dwellings even had a prospect of the
sea.&nbsp; A few planks formed passages from house to house,
which you must often scale, mounting steps like a ladder to
enter.</p>
<p>The only road across the rocks leads to a habitation sterile
enough, you may suppose, when I tell you that the little earth on
the adjacent ones was carried there by the late inhabitant.&nbsp;
A path, almost impracticable for a horse, goes on to Arendall,
still further to the westward.</p>
<p>I inquired for a walk, and, mounting near two hundred steps
made round a rock, walked up and down for about a hundred yards
viewing the sea, to which I quickly descended by steps that
cheated the declivity.&nbsp; The ocean and these tremendous
bulwarks enclosed me on every side.&nbsp; I felt the confinement,
and wished for wings to reach still loftier cliffs, whose
slippery sides no foot was so hardy as to tread.&nbsp; Yet what
was it to see?&mdash;only a boundless waste of water&mdash;not a
glimpse of smiling nature&mdash;not a patch of lively green to
relieve the aching sight, or vary the objects of meditation.</p>
<p>I felt my breath oppressed, though nothing could be clearer
than the atmosphere.&nbsp; Wandering there alone, I found the
solitude desirable; my mind was stored with ideas, which this new
scene associated with astonishing rapidity.&nbsp; But I shuddered
at the thought of receiving existence, and remaining here, in the
solitude of ignorance, till forced to leave a world of which I
had seen so little, for the character of the inhabitants is as
uncultivated, if not as picturesquely wild, as their abode.</p>
<p>Having no employment but traffic, of which a contraband trade
makes the basis of their profit, the coarsest feelings of honesty
are quickly blunted.&nbsp; You may suppose that I speak in
general terms; and that, with all the disadvantages of nature and
circumstances, there are still some respectable exceptions, the
more praiseworthy, as tricking is a very contagious mental
disease, that dries up all the generous juices of the
heart.&nbsp; Nothing genial, in fact, appears around this place,
or within the circle of its rocks.&nbsp; And, now I recollect, it
seems to me that the most genial and humane characters I have met
with in life were most alive to the sentiments inspired by
tranquil country scenes.&nbsp; What, indeed, is to humanise these
beings, who rest shut up (for they seldom even open their
windows), smoking, drinking brandy, and driving bargains?&nbsp; I
have been almost stifled by these smokers.&nbsp; They begin in
the morning, and are rarely without their pipe till they go to
bed.&nbsp; Nothing can be more disgusting than the rooms and men
towards the evening&mdash;breath, teeth, clothes, and furniture,
all are spoilt.&nbsp; It is well that the women are not very
delicate, or they would only love their husbands because they
were their husbands.&nbsp; Perhaps, you may add, that the remark
need not be confined to so small a part of the world; and,
<i>entre nous</i>, I am of the same opinion.&nbsp; You must not
term this innuendo saucy, for it does not come home.</p>
<p>If I had not determined to write I should have found my
confinement here, even for three or four days, tedious.&nbsp; I
have no books; and to pace up and down a small room, looking at
tiles overhung by rocks, soon becomes wearisome.&nbsp; I cannot
mount two hundred steps to walk a hundred yards many times in the
day.&nbsp; Besides, the rocks, retaining the heat of the sun, are
intolerably warm.&nbsp; I am, nevertheless, very well; for though
there is a shrewdness in the character of these people, depraved
by a sordid love of money which repels me, still the comparisons
they force me to make keep my heart calm by exercising my
understanding.</p>
<p>Everywhere wealth commands too much respect, but here almost
exclusively; and it is the only object pursued, not through brake
and briar, but over rocks and waves; yet of what use would riches
be to me, I have sometimes asked myself, were I confined to live
in such in a spot?&nbsp; I could only relieve a few distressed
objects, perhaps render them idle, and all the rest of life would
be a blank.</p>
<p>My present journey has given fresh force to my opinion that no
place is so disagreeable and unimproving as a country town.&nbsp;
I should like to divide my time between the town and country; in
a lone house, with the business of farming and planting, where my
mind would gain strength by solitary musing, and in a metropolis
to rub off the rust of thought, and polish the taste which the
contemplation of nature had rendered just.&nbsp; Thus do we wish
as we float down the stream of life, whilst chance does more to
gratify a desire of knowledge than our best laid plans.&nbsp; A
degree of exertion, produced by some want, more or less painful,
is probably the price we must all pay for knowledge.&nbsp; How
few authors or artists have arrived at eminence who have not
lived by their employment?</p>
<p>I was interrupted yesterday by business, and was prevailed
upon to dine with the English vice-consul.&nbsp; His house being
open to the sea, I was more at large; and the hospitality of the
table pleased me, though the bottle was rather too freely pushed
about.&nbsp; Their manner of entertaining was such as I have
frequently remarked when I have been thrown in the way of people
without education, who have more money than wit&mdash;that is,
than they know what to do with.&nbsp; The women were unaffected,
but had not the natural grace which was often conspicuous at
Tonsberg.&nbsp; There was even a striking difference in their
dress, these having loaded themselves with finery in the style of
the sailors&rsquo; girls of Hull or Portsmouth.&nbsp; Taste has
not yet taught them to make any but an ostentatious display of
wealth.&nbsp; Yet I could perceive even here the first steps of
the improvement which I am persuaded will make a very obvious
progress in the course of half a century, and it ought not to be
sooner, to keep pace with the cultivation of the earth.&nbsp;
Improving manners will introduce finer moral feelings.&nbsp; They
begin to read translations of some of the most useful German
productions lately published, and one of our party sung a song
ridiculing the powers coalesced against France, and the company
drank confusion to those who had dismembered Poland.</p>
<p>The evening was extremely calm and beautiful.&nbsp; Not being
able to walk, I requested a boat as the only means of enjoying
free air.</p>
<p>The view of the town was now extremely fine.&nbsp; A huge
rocky mountain stood up behind it, and a vast cliff stretched on
each side, forming a semicircle.&nbsp; In a recess of the rocks
was a clump of pines, amongst which a steeple rose picturesquely
beautiful.</p>
<p>The churchyard is almost the only verdant spot in the
place.&nbsp; Here, indeed, friendship extends beyond the grave,
and to grant a sod of earth is to accord a favour.&nbsp; I should
rather choose, did it admit of a choice, to sleep in some of the
caves of the rocks, for I am become better reconciled to them
since I climbed their craggy sides last night, listening to the
finest echoes I ever heard.&nbsp; We had a French horn with us,
and there was an enchanting wildness in the dying away of the
reverberation that quickly transported me to Shakespeare&rsquo;s
magic island.&nbsp; Spirits unseen seemed to walk abroad, and
flit from cliff to cliff to soothe my soul to peace.</p>
<p>I reluctantly returned to supper, to be shut up in a warm
room, only to view the vast shadows of the rocks extending on the
slumbering waves.&nbsp; I stood at the window some time before a
buzz filled the drawing-room, and now and then the dashing of a
solitary oar rendered the scene still more solemn.</p>
<p>Before I came here I could scarcely have imagined that a
simple object (rocks) could have admitted of so many interesting
combinations, always grand and often sublime.&nbsp; Good
night!&nbsp; God bless you!</p>
<h2>LETTER XII.</h2>
<p>I left East Rusoer the day before yesterday.&nbsp; The weather
was very fine; but so calm that we loitered on the water near
fourteen hours, only to make about six and twenty miles.</p>
<p>It seemed to me a sort of emancipation when we landed at
Helgeraac.&nbsp; The confinement which everywhere struck me
whilst sojourning amongst the rocks, made me hail the earth as a
land of promise; and the situation shone with fresh lustre from
the contrast&mdash;from appearing to be a free abode.&nbsp; Here
it was possible to travel by land&mdash;I never thought this a
comfort before&mdash;and my eyes, fatigued by the sparkling of
the sun on the water, now contentedly reposed on the green
expanse, half persuaded that such verdant meads had never till
then regaled them.</p>
<p>I rose early to pursue my journey to Tonsberg.&nbsp; The
country still wore a face of joy&mdash;and my soul was alive to
its charms.&nbsp; Leaving the most lofty and romantic of the
cliffs behind us, we were almost continually descending to
Tonsberg, through Elysian scenes; for not only the sea, but
mountains, rivers, lakes, and groves, gave an almost endless
variety to the prospect.&nbsp; The cottagers were still carrying
home the hay; and the cottages on this road looked very
comfortable.&nbsp; Peace and plenty&mdash;I mean not
abundance&mdash;seemed to reign around&mdash;still I grew sad as
I drew near my old abode.&nbsp; I was sorry to see the sun so
high; it was broad noon.&nbsp; Tonsberg was something like a
home&mdash;yet I was to enter without lighting up pleasure in any
eye.&nbsp; I dreaded the solitariness of my apartment, and wished
for night to hide the starting tears, or to shed them on my
pillow, and close my eyes on a world where I was destined to
wander alone.&nbsp; Why has nature so many charms for
me&mdash;calling forth and cherishing refined sentiments, only to
wound the breast that fosters them?&nbsp; How illusive, perhaps
the most so, are the plans of happiness founded on virtue and
principle; what inlets of misery do they not open in a
half-civilised society?&nbsp; The satisfaction arising from
conscious rectitude, will not calm an injured heart, when
tenderness is ever finding excuses; and self-applause is a cold
solitary feeling, that cannot supply the place of disappointed
affection, without throwing a gloom over every prospect, which,
banishing pleasure, does not exclude pain.&nbsp; I reasoned and
reasoned; but my heart was too full to allow me to remain in the
house, and I walked, till I was wearied out, to purchase
rest&mdash;or rather forgetfulness.</p>
<p>Employment has beguiled this day, and to-morrow I set out for
Moss, on my way to Stromstad.&nbsp; At Gothenburg I shall embrace
my Fannikin; probably she will not know me again&mdash;and I
shall be hurt if she do not.&nbsp; How childish is this! still it
is a natural feeling.&nbsp; I would not permit myself to indulge
the &ldquo;thick coming fears&rdquo; of fondness, whilst I was
detained by business.&nbsp; Yet I never saw a calf bounding in a
meadow, that did not remind me of my little frolicker.&nbsp; A
calf, you say.&nbsp; Yes; but a capital one I own.</p>
<p>I cannot write composedly&mdash;I am every instant sinking
into reveries&mdash;my heart flutters, I know not why.&nbsp;
Fool!&nbsp; It is time thou wert at rest.</p>
<p>Friendship and domestic happiness are continually praised; yet
how little is there of either in the world, because it requires
more cultivation of mind to keep awake affection, even in our own
hearts, than the common run of people suppose.&nbsp; Besides, few
like to be seen as they really are; and a degree of simplicity,
and of undisguised confidence, which, to uninterested observers,
would almost border on weakness, is the charm, nay the essence of
love or friendship, all the bewitching graces of childhood again
appearing.&nbsp; As objects merely to exercise my taste, I
therefore like to see people together who have an affection for
each other; every turn of their features touches me, and remains
pictured on my imagination in indelible characters.&nbsp; The
zest of novelty is, however, necessary to rouse the languid
sympathies which have been hackneyed in the world; as is the
factitious behaviour, falsely termed good-breeding, to amuse
those, who, defective in taste, continually rely for pleasure on
their animal spirits, which not being maintained by the
imagination, are unavoidably sooner exhausted than the sentiments
of the heart.&nbsp; Friendship is in general sincere at the
commencement, and lasts whilst there is anything to support it;
but as a mixture of novelty and vanity is the usual prop, no
wonder if it fall with the slender stay.&nbsp; The fop in the
play paid a greater compliment than he was aware of when he said
to a person, whom he meant to flatter, &ldquo;I like you almost
as well as a <i>new acquaintance</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Why am I
talking of friendship, after which I have had such a wild-goose
chase.&nbsp; I thought only of telling you that the crows, as
well as wild-geese, are here birds of passage.</p>
<h2>LETTER XIII.</h2>
<p>I left Tonsberg yesterday, the 22nd of August.&nbsp; It is
only twelve or thirteen English miles to Moss, through a country
less wild than any tract I had hitherto passed over in
Norway.&nbsp; It was often beautiful, but seldom afforded those
grand views which fill rather than soothe the mind.</p>
<p>We glided along the meadows and through the woods, with
sunbeams playing around us; and, though no castles adorned the
prospects, a greater number of comfortable farms met my eyes
during this ride than I have ever seen, in the same space, even
in the most cultivated part of England; and the very appearance
of the cottages of the labourers sprinkled amidst them excluded
all those gloomy ideas inspired by the contemplation of
poverty.</p>
<p>The hay was still bringing in, for one harvest in Norway
treads on the heels of the other.&nbsp; The woods were more
variegated, interspersed with shrubs.&nbsp; We no longer passed
through forests of vast pines stretching along with savage
magnificence.&nbsp; Forests that only exhibited the slow decay of
time or the devastation produced by warring elements.&nbsp; No;
oaks, ashes, beech, and all the light and graceful tenants of our
woods here sported luxuriantly.&nbsp; I had not observed many
oaks before, for the greater part of the oak-planks, I am
informed, come from the westward.</p>
<p>In France the farmers generally live in villages, which is a
great disadvantage to the country; but the Norwegian farmers,
always owning their farms or being tenants for life, reside in
the midst of them, allowing some labourers a dwelling rent free,
who have a little land appertaining to the cottage, not only for
a garden, but for crops of different kinds, such as rye, oats,
buck-wheat, hemp, flax, beans, potatoes, and hay, which are sown
in strips about it, reminding a stranger of the first attempts at
culture, when every family was obliged to be an independent
community.</p>
<p>These cottagers work at a certain price (tenpence per day) for
the farmers on whose ground they live, and they have spare time
enough to cultivate their own land and lay in a store of fish for
the winter.&nbsp; The wives and daughters spin and the husbands
and sons weave, so that they may fairly be reckoned independent,
having also a little money in hand to buy coffee, brandy and some
other superfluities.</p>
<p>The only thing I disliked was the military service, which
trammels them more than I at first imagined.&nbsp; It is true
that the militia is only called out once a year, yet in case of
war they have no alternative but must abandon their
families.&nbsp; Even the manufacturers are not exempted, though
the miners are, in order to encourage undertakings which require
a capital at the commencement.&nbsp; And, what appears more
tyrannical, the inhabitants of certain districts are appointed
for the land, others for the sea service.&nbsp; Consequently, a
peasant, born a soldier, is not permitted to follow his
inclination should it lead him to go to sea, a natural desire
near so many seaports.</p>
<p>In these regulations the arbitrary government&mdash;the King
of Denmark being the most absolute monarch in
Europe&mdash;appears, which in other respects seeks to hide
itself in a lenity that almost renders the laws nullities.&nbsp;
If any alteration of old customs is thought of, the opinion of
the old country is required and maturely considered.&nbsp; I have
several times had occasion to observe that, fearing to appear
tyrannical, laws are allowed to become obsolete which ought to be
put in force or better substituted in their stead; for this
mistaken moderation, which borders on timidity, favours the least
respectable part of the people.</p>
<p>I saw on my way not only good parsonage houses, but
comfortable dwellings, with glebe land for the clerk, always a
consequential man in every country, a being proud of a little
smattering of learning, to use the appropriate epithet, and vain
of the stiff good-breeding reflected from the vicar, though the
servility practised in his company gives it a peculiar cast.</p>
<p>The widow of the clergyman is allowed to receive the benefit
of the living for a twelvemonth after the death of the
incumbent.</p>
<p>Arriving at the ferry (the passage over to Moss is about six
or eight English miles) I saw the most level shore I had yet seen
in Norway.&nbsp; The appearance of the circumjacent country had
been preparing me for the change of scene which was to greet me
when I reached the coast.&nbsp; For the grand features of nature
had been dwindling into prettiness as I advanced; yet the rocks,
on a smaller scale, were finely wooded to the water&rsquo;s
edge.&nbsp; Little art appeared, yet sublimity everywhere gave
place to elegance.&nbsp; The road had often assumed the
appearance of a gravelled one, made in pleasure-grounds; whilst
the trees excited only an idea of embellishment.&nbsp; Meadows,
like lawns, in an endless variety, displayed the careless graces
of nature; and the ripening corn gave a richness to the landscape
analogous with the other objects.</p>
<p>Never was a southern sky more beautiful, nor more soft its
gales.&nbsp; Indeed, I am led to conclude that the sweetest
summer in the world is the northern one, the vegetation being
quick and luxuriant the moment the earth is loosened from its icy
fetters and the bound streams regain their wonted activity.&nbsp;
The balance of happiness with respect to climate may be more
equal than I at first imagined; for the inhabitants describe with
warmth the pleasures of a winter at the thoughts of which I
shudder.&nbsp; Not only their parties of pleasure but of business
are reserved for this season, when they travel with astonishing
rapidity the most direct way, skimming over hedge and ditch.</p>
<p>On entering Moss I was struck by the animation which seemed to
result from industry.&nbsp; The richest of the inhabitants keep
shops, resembling in their manners and even the arrangement of
their houses the tradespeople of Yorkshire; with an air of more
independence, or rather consequence, from feeling themselves the
first people in the place.&nbsp; I had not time to see the
iron-works, belonging to Mr. Anker, of Christiania, a man of
fortune and enterprise; and I was not very anxious to see them
after having viewed those at Laurvig.</p>
<p>Here I met with an intelligent literary man, who was anxious
to gather information from me relative to the past and present
situation of France.&nbsp; The newspapers printed at Copenhagen,
as well as those in England, give the most exaggerated accounts
of their atrocities and distresses, but the former without any
apparent comments or inferences.&nbsp; Still the Norwegians,
though more connected with the English, speaking their language
and copying their manners, wish well to the Republican cause, and
follow with the most lively interest the successes of the French
arms.&nbsp; So determined were they, in fact, to excuse
everything, disgracing the struggle of freedom, by admitting the
tyrant&rsquo;s plea, necessity, that I could hardly persuade them
that Robespierre was a monster.</p>
<p>The discussion of this subject is not so general as in
England, being confined to the few, the clergy and physicians,
with a small portion of people who have a literary turn and
leisure; the greater part of the inhabitants having a variety of
occupations, being owners of ships, shopkeepers, and farmers,
have employment enough at home.&nbsp; And their ambition to
become rich may tend to cultivate the common sense which
characterises and narrows both their hearts and views, confirming
the former to their families, taking the handmaids of it into the
circle of pleasure, if not of interest, and the latter to the
inspection of their workmen, including the noble science of
bargain-making&mdash;that is, getting everything at the cheapest,
and selling it at the dearest rate.&nbsp; I am now more than ever
convinced that it is an intercourse with men of science and
artists which not only diffuses taste, but gives that freedom to
the understanding without which I have seldom met with much
benevolence of character on a large scale.</p>
<p>Besides, though you do not hear of much pilfering and stealing
in Norway, yet they will, with a quiet conscience, buy things at
a price which must convince them they were stolen.&nbsp; I had an
opportunity of knowing that two or three reputable people had
purchased some articles of vagrants, who were detected.&nbsp; How
much of the virtue which appears in the world is put on for the
world?&nbsp; And how little dictated by self-respect?&mdash;so
little, that I am ready to repeat the old question, and ask,
Where is truth, or rather principle, to be found?&nbsp; These
are, perhaps, the vapourings of a heart ill at ease&mdash;the
effusions of a sensibility wounded almost to madness.&nbsp; But
enough of this; we will discuss the subject in another state of
existence, where truth and justice will reign.&nbsp; How cruel
are the injuries which make us quarrel with human nature!&nbsp;
At present black melancholy hovers round my footsteps; and sorrow
sheds a mildew over all the future prospects, which hope no
longer gilds.</p>
<p>A rainy morning prevented my enjoying the pleasure the view of
a picturesque country would have afforded me; for though this
road passed through a country a greater extent of which was under
cultivation than I had usually seen here, it nevertheless
retained all the wild charms of Norway.&nbsp; Rocks still
enclosed the valleys, the great sides of which enlivened their
verdure.&nbsp; Lakes appeared like branches of the sea, and
branches of the sea assumed the appearance of tranquil lakes;
whilst streamlets prattled amongst the pebbles and the broken
mass of stone which had rolled into them, giving fantastic turns
to the trees, the roots of which they bared.</p>
<p>It is not, in fact, surprising that the pine should be often
undermined; it shoots its fibres in such a horizontal direction,
merely on the surface of the earth, requiring only enough to
cover those that cling to the crags.&nbsp; Nothing proves to me
so clearly that it is the air which principally nourishes trees
and plants as the flourishing appearance of these pines.&nbsp;
The firs, demanding a deeper soil, are seldom seen in equal
health, or so numerous on the barren cliffs.&nbsp; They take
shelter in the crevices, or where, after some revolving ages, the
pines have prepared them a footing.</p>
<p>Approaching, or rather descending, to Christiania, though the
weather continued a little cloudy, my eyes were charmed with the
view of an extensive undulated valley, stretching out under the
shelter of a noble amphitheatre of pine-covered mountains.&nbsp;
Farm houses scattered about animated, nay, graced a scene which
still retained so much of its native wildness, that the art which
appeared seemed so necessary, it was scarcely perceived.&nbsp;
Cattle were grazing in the shaven meadows; and the lively green
on their swelling sides contrasted with the ripening corn and
rye.&nbsp; The corn that grew on the slopes had not, indeed, the
laughing luxuriance of plenty, which I have seen in more genial
climes.&nbsp; A fresh breeze swept across the grain, parting its
slender stalks, but the wheat did not wave its head with its
wonted careless dignity, as if nature had crowned it the king of
plants.</p>
<p>The view, immediately on the left, as we drove down the
mountain, was almost spoilt by the depredations committed on the
rocks to make alum.&nbsp; I do not know the process.&nbsp; I only
saw that the rocks looked red after they had been burnt, and
regretted that the operation should leave a quantity of rubbish
to introduce an image of human industry in the shape of
destruction.&nbsp; The situation of Christiania is certainly
uncommonly fine, and I never saw a bay that so forcibly gave me
an idea of a place of safety from the storms of the ocean; all
the surrounding objects were beautiful and even grand.&nbsp; But
neither the rocky mountains, nor the woods that graced them,
could be compared with the sublime prospects I had seen to the
westward; and as for the hills, &ldquo;capped with <i>eternal</i>
snow,&rdquo; Mr. Coxe&rsquo;s description led me to look for
them, but they had flown, for I looked vainly around for this
noble background.</p>
<p>A few months ago the people of Christiania rose, exasperated
by the scarcity and consequent high price of grain.&nbsp; The
immediate cause was the shipping of some, said to be for Moss,
but which they suspected was only a pretext to send it out of the
country, and I am not sure that they were wrong in their
conjecture.&nbsp; Such are the tricks of trade.&nbsp; They threw
stones at Mr. Anker, the owner of it, as he rode out of town to
escape from their fury; they assembled about his house, and the
people demanded afterwards, with so much impetuosity, the liberty
of those who were taken up in consequence of the tumult, that the
Grand Bailiff thought it prudent to release them without further
altercation.</p>
<p>You may think me too severe on commerce, but from the manner
it is at present carried on little can be advanced in favour of a
pursuit that wears out the most sacred principles of humanity and
rectitude.&nbsp; What is speculation but a species of gambling, I
might have said fraud, in which address generally gains the
prize?&nbsp; I was led into these reflections when I heard of
some tricks practised by merchants, miscalled reputable, and
certainly men of property, during the present war, in which
common honesty was violated: damaged goods and provision having
been shipped for the express purpose of falling into the hands of
the English, who had pledged themselves to reimburse neutral
nations for the cargoes they seized; cannon also, sent back as
unfit for service, have been shipped as a good speculation, the
captain receiving orders to cruise about till he fell in with an
English frigate.&nbsp; Many individuals I believe have suffered
by the seizures of their vessels; still I am persuaded that the
English Government has been very much imposed upon in the charges
made by merchants who contrived to get their ships taken.&nbsp;
This censure is not confined to the Danes.&nbsp; Adieu, for the
present, I must take advantage of a moment of fine weather to
walk out and see the town.</p>
<p>At Christiania I met with that polite reception, which rather
characterises the progress of manners in the world, than of any
particular portion of it.&nbsp; The first evening of my arrival I
supped with some of the most fashionable people of the place, and
almost imagined myself in a circle of English ladies, so much did
they resemble them in manners, dress, and even in beauty; for the
fairest of my countrywomen would not have been sorry to rank with
the Grand Bailiff&rsquo;s lady.&nbsp; There were several pretty
girls present, but she outshone them all, and, what interested me
still more, I could not avoid observing that in acquiring the
easy politeness which distinguishes people of quality, she had
preserved her Norwegian simplicity.&nbsp; There was, in fact, a
graceful timidity in her address, inexpressibly charming.&nbsp;
This surprised me a little, because her husband was quite a
Frenchman of the <i>ancien r&eacute;gime</i>, or rather a
courtier, the same kind of animal in every country.</p>
<p>Here I saw the cloven foot of despotism.&nbsp; I boasted to
you that they had no viceroy in Norway, but these Grand Bailiffs,
particularly the superior one, who resides at Christiania, are
political monsters of the same species.&nbsp; Needy sycophants
are provided for by their relations and connections at Copenhagen
as at other courts.&nbsp; And though the Norwegians are not in
the abject state of the Irish, yet this second-hand government is
still felt by their being deprived of several natural advantages
to benefit the domineering state.</p>
<p>The Grand Bailiffs are mostly noblemen from Copenhagen, who
act as men of common minds will always act in such
situations&mdash;aping a degree of courtly parade which clashes
with the independent character of a magistrate.&nbsp; Besides,
they have a degree of power over the country judges, which some
of them, who exercise a jurisdiction truly patriarchal most
painfully feel.&nbsp; I can scarcely say why, my friend, but in
this city thoughtfulness seemed to be sliding into melancholy or
rather dulness.&nbsp; The fire of fancy, which had been kept
alive in the country, was almost extinguished by reflections on
the ills that harass such a large portion of mankind.&nbsp; I
felt like a bird fluttering on the ground unable to mount, yet
unwilling to crawl tranquilly like a reptile, whilst still
conscious it had wings.</p>
<p>I walked out, for the open air is always my remedy when an
aching head proceeds from an oppressed heart.&nbsp; Chance
directed my steps towards the fortress, and the sight of the
slaves, working with chains on their legs, only served to
embitter me still more against the regulations of society, which
treated knaves in such a different manner, especially as there
was a degree of energy in some of their countenances which
unavoidably excited my attention, and almost created respect.</p>
<p>I wished to have seen, through an iron grate, the face of a
man who has been confined six years for having induced the
farmers to revolt against some impositions of the
Government.&nbsp; I could not obtain a clear account of the
affair, yet, as the complaint was against some farmers of taxes,
I am inclined to believe that it was not totally without
foundation.&nbsp; He must have possessed some eloquence, or have
had truth on his side; for the farmers rose by hundreds to
support him, and were very much exasperated at his imprisonment,
which will probably last for life, though he has sent several
very spirited remonstrances to the upper court, which makes the
judges so averse to giving a sentence which may be cavilled at,
that they take advantage of the glorious uncertainty of the law,
to protract a decision which is only to be regulated by reasons
of state.</p>
<p>The greater number of the slaves I saw here were not confined
for life.&nbsp; Their labour is not hard; and they work in the
open air, which prevents their constitutions from suffering by
imprisonment.&nbsp; Still, as they are allowed to associate
together, and boast of their dexterity, not only to each other
but to the soldiers around them, in the garrison; they commonly,
it is natural to conclude, go out more confirmed and more expert
knaves than when they entered.</p>
<p>It is not necessary to trace the origin of the association of
ideas which led me to think that the stars and gold keys, which
surrounded me the evening before, disgraced the wearers as much
as the fetters I was viewing&mdash;perhaps more.&nbsp; I even
began to investigate the reason, which led me to suspect that the
former produced the latter.</p>
<p>The Norwegians are extravagantly fond of courtly distinction,
and of titles, though they have no immunities annexed to them,
and are easily purchased.&nbsp; The proprietors of mines have
many privileges: they are almost exempt from taxes, and the
peasantry born on their estates, as well as those on the
counts&rsquo;, are not born soldiers or sailors.</p>
<p>One distinction, or rather trophy of nobility, which I might
have occurred to the Hottentots, amused me; it was a bunch of
hog&rsquo;s bristles placed on the horses&rsquo; heads,
surmounting that part of the harness to which a round piece of
brass often dangles, fatiguing the eye with its idle motion.</p>
<p>From the fortress I returned to my lodging, and quickly was
taken out of town to be shown a pretty villa, and English
garden.&nbsp; To a Norwegian both might have been objects of
curiosity; and of use, by exciting to the comparison which leads
to improvement.&nbsp; But whilst I gazed, I was employed in
restoring the place to nature, or taste, by giving it the
character of the surrounding scene.&nbsp; Serpentine walks, and
flowering-shrubs, looked trifling in a grand recess of the rooks,
shaded by towering pines.&nbsp; Groves of smaller trees might
have been sheltered under them, which would have melted into the
landscape, displaying only the art which ought to point out the
vicinity of a human abode, furnished with some elegance.&nbsp;
But few people have sufficient taste to discern, that the art of
embellishing consists in interesting, not in astonishing.</p>
<p>Christiania is certainly very pleasantly situated, and the
environs I passed through, during this ride, afforded many fine
and cultivated prospects; but, excepting the first view
approaching to it, rarely present any combination of objects so
strikingly new, or picturesque, as to command remembrance.&nbsp;
Adieu!</p>
<h2>LETTER XIV.</h2>
<p>Christiania is a clean, neat city; but it has none of the
graces of architecture, which ought to keep pace with the
refining manners of a people&mdash;or the outside of the house
will disgrace the inside, giving the beholder an idea of
overgrown wealth devoid of taste.&nbsp; Large square wooden
houses offend the eye, displaying more than Gothic
barbarism.&nbsp; Huge Gothic piles, indeed, exhibit a
characteristic sublimity, and a wildness of fancy peculiar to the
period when they were erected; but size, without grandeur or
elegance, has an emphatical stamp of meanness, of poverty of
conception, which only a commercial spirit could give.</p>
<p>The same thought has struck me, when I have entered the
meeting-house of my respected friend, Dr. Price.&nbsp; I am
surprised that the dissenters, who have not laid aside all the
pomps and vanities of life, should imagine a noble pillar, or
arch, unhallowed.&nbsp; Whilst men have senses, whatever soothes
them lends wings to devotion; else why do the beauties of nature,
where all that charm them are spread around with a lavish hand,
force even the sorrowing heart to acknowledge that existence is a
blessing? and this acknowledgment is the most sublime homage we
can pay to the Deity.</p>
<p>The argument of convenience is absurd.&nbsp; Who would labour
for wealth, if it were to procure nothing but conveniences.&nbsp;
If we wish to render mankind moral from principle, we must, I am
persuaded, give a greater scope to the enjoyments of the senses
by blending taste with them.&nbsp; This has frequently occurred
to me since I have been in the north, and observed that there
sanguine characters always take refuge in drunkenness after the
fire of youth is spent.</p>
<p>But I have flown from Norway.&nbsp; To go back to the wooden
houses; farms constructed with logs, and even little villages,
here erected in the same simple manner, have appeared to me very
picturesque.&nbsp; In the more remote parts I had been
particularly pleased with many cottages situated close to a
brook, or bordering on a lake, with the whole farm
contiguous.&nbsp; As the family increases, a little more land is
cultivated; thus the country is obviously enriched by
population.&nbsp; Formerly the farmers might more justly have
been termed woodcutters.&nbsp; But now they find it necessary to
spare the woods a little, and this change will be universally
beneficial; for whilst they lived entirely by selling the trees
they felled, they did not pay sufficient attention to husbandry;
consequently, advanced very slowly in agricultural
knowledge.&nbsp; Necessity will in future more and more spur them
on; for the ground, cleared of wood, must be cultivated, or the
farm loses its value; there is no waiting for food till another
generation of pines be grown to maturity.</p>
<p>The people of property are very careful of their timber; and,
rambling through a forest near Tonsberg, belonging to the Count,
I have stopped to admire the appearance of some of the cottages
inhabited by a woodman&rsquo;s family&mdash;a man employed to cut
down the wood necessary for the household and the estate.&nbsp; A
little lawn was cleared, on which several lofty trees were left
which nature had grouped, whilst the encircling firs sported with
wild grace.&nbsp; The dwelling was sheltered by the forest, noble
pines spreading their branches over the roof; and before the door
a cow, goat, nag, and children, seemed equally content with their
lot; and if contentment be all we can attain, it is, perhaps,
best secured by ignorance.</p>
<p>As I have been most delighted with the country parts of
Norway, I was sorry to leave Christiania without going farther to
the north, though the advancing season admonished me to depart,
as well as the calls of business and affection.</p>
<p>June and July are the months to make a tour through Norway;
for then the evenings and nights are the finest I have ever seen;
but towards the middle or latter end of August the clouds begin
to gather, and summer disappears almost before it has ripened the
fruit of autumn&mdash;even, as it were, slips from your embraces,
whilst the satisfied senses seem to rest in enjoyment.</p>
<p>You will ask, perhaps, why I wished to go farther
northward.&nbsp; Why? not only because the country, from all I
can gather, is most romantic, abounding in forests and lakes, and
the air pure, but I have heard much of the intelligence of the
inhabitants, substantial farmers, who have none of that cunning
to contaminate their simplicity, which displeased me so much in
the conduct of the people on the sea coast.&nbsp; A man who has
been detected in any dishonest act can no longer live among
them.&nbsp; He is universally shunned, and shame becomes the
severest punishment.</p>
<p>Such a contempt have they, in fact, for every species of
fraud, that they will not allow the people on the western coast
to be their countrymen; so much do they despise the arts for
which those traders who live on the rocks are notorious.</p>
<p>The description I received of them carried me back to the
fables of the golden age: independence and virtue; affluence
without vice; cultivation of mind, without depravity of heart;
with &ldquo;ever smiling Liberty;&rdquo; the nymph of the
mountain.&nbsp; I want faith!</p>
<p>My imagination hurries me forward to seek an asylum in such a
retreat from all the disappointments I am threatened with; but
reason drags me back, whispering that the world is still the
world, and man the same compound of weakness and folly, who must
occasionally excite love and disgust, admiration and
contempt.&nbsp; But this description, though it seems to have
been sketched by a fairy pencil, was given me by a man of sound
understanding, whose fancy seldom appears to run away with
him.</p>
<p>A law in Norway, termed the <i>odels right</i>, has lately
been modified, and probably will be abolished as an impediment to
commerce.&nbsp; The heir of an estate had the power of
re-purchasing it at the original purchase money, making allowance
for such improvements as were absolutely necessary, during the
space of twenty years.&nbsp; At present ten is the term allowed
for afterthought; and when the regulation was made, all the men
of abilities were invited to give their opinion whether it were
better to abrogate or modify it.&nbsp; It is certainly a
convenient and safe way of mortgaging land; yet the most rational
men whom I conversed with on the subject seemed convinced that
the right was more injurious than beneficial to society; still if
it contribute to keep the farms in the farmers&rsquo; own hands,
I should be sorry to hear that it were abolished.</p>
<p>The aristocracy in Norway, if we keep clear of Christiania, is
far from being formidable; and it will require a long the to
enable the merchants to attain a sufficient moneyed interest to
induce them to reinforce the upper class at the expense of the
yeomanry, with whom they are usually connected.</p>
<p>England and America owe their liberty to commerce, which
created new species of power to undermine the feudal
system.&nbsp; But let them beware of the consequence; the tyranny
of wealth is still more galling and debasing than that of
rank.</p>
<p>Farewell!&nbsp; I must prepare for my departure.</p>
<h2>LETTER XV.</h2>
<p>I left Christiania yesterday.&nbsp; The weather was not very
fine, and having been a little delayed on the road, I found that
it was too late to go round, a couple of miles, to see the
cascade near Fredericstadt, which I had determined to
visit.&nbsp; Besides, as Fredericstadt is a fortress, it was
necessary to arrive there before they shut the gate.</p>
<p>The road along the river is very romantic, though the views
are not grand; and the riches of Norway, its timber, floats
silently down the stream, often impeded in its course by islands
and little cataracts, the offspring, as it were, of the great one
I had frequently heard described.</p>
<p>I found an excellent inn at Fredericstadt, and was gratified
by the kind attention of the hostess, who, perceiving that my
clothes were wet, took great pains procure me, as a stranger,
every comfort for the night.</p>
<p>It had rained very hard, and we passed the ferry in the dark
without getting out of our carriage, which I think wrong, as the
horses are sometimes unruly.&nbsp; Fatigue and melancholy,
however, had made me regardless whether I went down or across the
stream, and I did not know that I was wet before the hostess
marked it.&nbsp; My imagination has never yet severed me from my
griefs, and my mind has seldom been so free as to allow my body
to be delicate.</p>
<p>How I am altered by disappointment!&nbsp; When going to
Lisbon, the elasticity of my mind was sufficient to ward off
weariness, and my imagination still could dip her brush in the
rainbow of fancy, and sketch futurity in glowing colours.&nbsp;
Now&mdash;but let me talk of something else&mdash;will you go
with me to the cascade?</p>
<p>The cross road to it was rugged and dreary; and though a
considerable extent of land was cultivated on all sides, yet the
rocks were entirely bare, which surprised me, as they were more
on a level with the surface than any I had yet seen.&nbsp; On
inquiry, however, I learnt that some years since a forest had
been burnt.&nbsp; This appearance of desolation was beyond
measure gloomy, inspiring emotions that sterility had never
produced.&nbsp; Fires of this kind are occasioned by the wind
suddenly rising when the farmers are burning roots of trees,
stalks of beans, &amp;c, with which they manure the ground.&nbsp;
The devastation must, indeed, be terrible, when this, literally
speaking, wildfire, runs along the forest, flying from top to
top, and crackling amongst the branches.&nbsp; The soil, as well
as the trees, is swept away by the destructive torrent; and the
country, despoiled of beauty and riches, is left to mourn for
ages.</p>
<p>Admiring, as I do, these noble forests, which seem to bid
defiance to time, I looked with pain on the ridge of rocks that
stretched far beyond my eye, formerly crowned with the most
beautiful verdure.</p>
<p>I have often mentioned the grandeur, but I feel myself unequal
to the task of conveying an idea of the beauty and elegance of
the scene when the spiry tops of the pines are loaded with
ripening seed, and the sun gives a glow to their light-green
tinge, which is changing into purple, one tree more or less
advanced contrasted with another.&nbsp; The profusion with which
Nature has decked them with pendant honours, prevents all
surprise at seeing in every crevice some sapling struggling for
existence.&nbsp; Vast masses of stone are thus encircled, and
roots torn up by the storms become a shelter for a young
generation.&nbsp; The pine and fir woods, left entirely to
Nature, display an endless variety; and the paths in the woods
are not entangled with fallen leaves, which are only interesting
whilst they are fluttering between life and death.&nbsp; The grey
cobweb-like appearance of the aged pines is a much finer image of
decay; the fibres whitening as they lose their moisture,
imprisoned life seems to be stealing away.&nbsp; I cannot tell
why, but death, under every form, appears to me like something
getting free to expand in I know not what element&mdash;nay, I
feel that this conscious being must be as unfettered, have the
wings of thought, before it can be happy.</p>
<p>Reaching the cascade, or rather cataract, the roaring of which
had a long time announced its vicinity, my soul was hurried by
the falls into a new train of reflections.&nbsp; The impetuous
dashing of the rebounding torrent from the dark cavities which
mocked the exploring eye produced an equal activity in my
mind.&nbsp; My thoughts darted from earth to heaven, and I asked
myself why I was chained to life and its misery.&nbsp; Still the
tumultuous emotions this sublime object excited were pleasurable;
and, viewing it, my soul rose with renewed dignity above its
cares.&nbsp; Grasping at immortality&mdash;it seemed as
impossible to stop the current of my thoughts, as of the always
varying, still the same, torrent before me; I stretched out my
hand to eternity, bounding over the dark speck of life to
come.</p>
<p>We turned with regret from the cascade.&nbsp; On a little
hill, which commands the best view of it, several obelisks are
erected to commemorate the visits of different kings.&nbsp; The
appearance of the river above and below the falls is very
picturesque, the ruggedness of the scenery disappearing as the
torrent subsides into a peaceful stream.&nbsp; But I did not like
to see a number of saw-mills crowded together close to the
cataracts; they destroyed the harmony of the prospect.</p>
<p>The sight of a bridge erected across a deep valley, at a
little distance, inspired very dissimilar sensations.&nbsp; It
was most ingeniously supported by mast-like trunks, just stripped
of their branches; and logs, placed one across the other,
produced an appearance equally light and firm, seeming almost to
be built in the air when we were below it, the height taking from
the magnitude of the supporting trees give them a slender
graceful look.</p>
<p>There are two noble estates in this neighbourhood, the
proprietors of which seem to have caught more than their portion
of the enterprising spirit that is gone abroad.&nbsp; Many
agricultural experiments have been made, and the country appears
better enclosed and cultivated, yet the cottages had not the
comfortable aspect of those I had observed near Moss and to the
westward.&nbsp; Man is always debased by servitude of any
description, and here the peasantry are not entirely free.&nbsp;
Adieu!</p>
<p>I almost forgot to tell you that I did not leave Norway
without making some inquiries after the monsters said to have
been seen in the northern sea; but though I conversed with
several captains, I could not meet with one who had ever heard
any traditional description of them, much less had any ocular
demonstration of their existence.&nbsp; Till the fact is better
ascertained, I should think the account of them ought to be torn
out of our geographical grammars.</p>
<h2>LETTER XVI.</h2>
<p>I set out from Fredericstadt about three o&rsquo;clock in the
afternoon, and expected to reach Stromstad before the night
closed in; but the wind dying away, the weather became so calm
that we scarcely made any perceptible advances towards the
opposite coast, though the men were fatigued with rowing.</p>
<p>Getting amongst the rocks and islands as the moon rose, and
the stars darted forward out of the clear expanse, I forgot that
the night stole on whilst indulging affectionate reveries, the
poetical fictions of sensibility; I was not, therefore, aware of
the length of time we had been toiling to reach Stromstad.&nbsp;
And when I began to look around, I did not perceive anything to
indicate that we were in its neighbourhood.&nbsp; So far from it,
that when I inquired of the pilot, who spoke a little English, I
found that he was only accustomed to coast along the Norwegian
shore; and had been only once across to Stromstad.&nbsp; But he
had brought with him a fellow better acquainted, he assured me,
with the rocks by which they were to steer our course, for we had
not a compass on board; yet, as he was half a fool, I had little
confidence in his skill.&nbsp; There was then great reason to
fear that we had lost our way, and were straying amidst a
labyrinth of rocks without a clue.</p>
<p>This was something like an adventure, but not of the most
agreeable cast; besides, I was impatient to arrive at Stromstad,
to be able to send forward that night a boy to order horses on
the road to be ready, for I was unwilling to remain there a day
without having anything to detain me from my little girl, and
from the letters which I was impatient to get from you.</p>
<p>I began to expostulate, and even to scold the pilot, for not
having informed me of his ignorance previous to my
departure.&nbsp; This made him row with more force, and we turned
round one rock only to see another, equally destitute of the
tokens we were in search of to tell us where we were.&nbsp;
Entering also into creek after creek which promised to be the
entrance of the bay we were seeking, we advanced merely to find
ourselves running aground.</p>
<p>The solitariness of the scene, as we glided under the dark
shadows of the rocks, pleased me for a while; but the fear of
passing the whole night thus wandering to and fro, and losing the
next day, roused me.&nbsp; I begged the pilot to return to one of
the largest islands, at the side of which we had seen a boat
moored.&nbsp; As we drew nearer, a light through a window on the
summit became our beacon; but we were farther off than I
supposed.</p>
<p>With some difficulty the pilot got on shore, not
distinguishing the landing-place; and I remained in the boat,
knowing that all the relief we could expect was a man to direct
us.&nbsp; After waiting some time, for there is an insensibility
in the very movements of these people that would weary more than
ordinary patience, he brought with him a man who, assisting them
to row, we landed at Stromstad a little after one in the
morning.</p>
<p>It was too late to send off a boy, but I did not go to bed
before I had made the arrangements necessary to enable me to set
out as early as possible.</p>
<p>The sun rose with splendour.&nbsp; My mind was too active to
allow me to loiter long in bed, though the horses did not arrive
till between seven and eight.&nbsp; However, as I wished to let
the boy, who went forward to order the horses, get considerably
the start of me, I bridled in my impatience.</p>
<p>This precaution was unavailing, for after the three first
posts I had to wait two hours, whilst the people at the
post-house went, fair and softly, to the farm, to bid them bring
up the horses which were carrying in the first-fruits of the
harvest.&nbsp; I discovered here that these sluggish peasants had
their share of cunning.&nbsp; Though they had made me pay for a
horse, the boy had gone on foot, and only arrived half an hour
before me.&nbsp; This disconcerted the whole arrangement of the
day; and being detained again three hours, I reluctantly
determined to sleep at Quistram, two posts short of Uddervalla,
where I had hoped to have arrived that night.</p>
<p>But when I reached Quistram I found I could not approach the
door of the inn for men, horses, and carts, cows, and pigs
huddled together.&nbsp; From the concourse of people I had met on
the road I conjectured that there was a fair in the
neighbourhood; this crowd convinced me that it was but too
true.&nbsp; The boisterous merriment that almost every instant
produced a quarrel, or made me dread one, with the clouds of
tobacco, and fumes of brandy, gave an infernal appearance to the
scene.&nbsp; There was everything to drive me back, nothing to
excite sympathy in a rude tumult of the senses, which I foresaw
would end in a gross debauch.&nbsp; What was to be done?&nbsp; No
bed was to be had, or even a quiet corner to retire to for a
moment; all was lost in noise, riot, and confusion.</p>
<p>After some debating they promised me horses, which were to go
on to Uddervalla, two stages.&nbsp; I requested something to eat
first, not having dined; and the hostess, whom I have mentioned
to you before as knowing how to take care of herself, brought me
a plate of fish, for which she charged a rix-dollar and a
half.&nbsp; This was making hay whilst the sun shone.&nbsp; I was
glad to get out of the uproar, though not disposed to travel in
an incommodious open carriage all night, had I thought that there
was any chance of getting horses.</p>
<p>Quitting Quistram I met a number of joyous groups, and though
the evening was fresh many were stretched on the grass like weary
cattle; and drunken men had fallen by the road-side.&nbsp; On a
rock, under the shade of lofty trees, a large party of men and
women had lighted a fire, cutting down fuel around to keep it
alive all night.&nbsp; They were drinking, smoking, and laughing
with all their might and main.&nbsp; I felt for the trees whose
torn branches strewed the ground.&nbsp; Hapless nymphs! your
haunts, I fear, were polluted by many an unhallowed flame, the
casual burst of the moment!</p>
<p>The horses went on very well; but when we drew near the
post-house the postillion stopped short and neither threats nor
promises could prevail on him to go forward.&nbsp; He even began
to howl and weep when I insisted on his keeping his word.&nbsp;
Nothing, indeed, can equal the stupid obstinacy of some of these
half-alive beings, who seem to have been made by Prometheus when
the fire he stole from Heaven was so exhausted that he could only
spare a spark to give life, not animation, to the inert clay.</p>
<p>It was some time before we could rouse anybody; and, as I
expected, horses, we were told, could not be had in less than
four or five hours.&nbsp; I again attempted to bribe the churlish
brute who brought us there, but I discovered that, in spite of
the courteous hostess&rsquo;s promises, he had received orders
not to go any father.</p>
<p>As there was no remedy I entered, and was almost driven back
by the stench&mdash;a softer phrase would not have conveyed an
idea of the hot vapour that issued from an apartment in which
some eight or ten people were sleeping, not to reckon the cats
and dogs stretched on the floor.&nbsp; Two or three of the men or
women were on the benches, others on old chests; and one figure
started half out of a trunk to look at me, whom might have taken
for a ghost, had the chemise been white, to contrast with the
sallow visage.&nbsp; But the costume of apparitions not being
preserved I passed, nothing dreading, excepting the effluvia,
warily amongst the pots, pans, milk-pails, and
washing-tubs.&nbsp; After scaling a ruinous staircase I was shown
a bed-chamber.&nbsp; The bed did not invite me to enter; opening,
therefore, the window, and taking some clean towels out of my
night-sack, I spread them over the coverlid, on which tired
Nature found repose, in spite of the previous disgust.</p>
<p>With the grey of the morn the birds awoke me; and descending
to inquire for the horses, I hastened through the apartment I
have already described, not wishing to associate the idea of a
pigstye with that of a human dwelling.</p>
<p>I do not now wonder that the girls lose their fine complexions
at such an early age, or that love here is merely an appetite to
fulfil the main design of Nature, never enlivened by either
affection or sentiment.</p>
<p>For a few posts we found the horses waiting; but afterwards I
was retarded, as before, by the peasants, who, taking advantage
of my ignorance of the language, made me pay for the fourth horse
that ought to have gone forward to have the others in readiness,
though it had never been sent.&nbsp; I was particularly impatient
at the last post, as I longed to assure myself that my child was
well.</p>
<p>My impatience, however, did not prevent my enjoying the
journey.&nbsp; I had six weeks before passed over the same
ground; still it had sufficient novelty to attract my attention,
and beguile, if not banish, the sorrow that had taken up its
abode in my heart.&nbsp; How interesting are the varied beauties
of Nature, and what peculiar charms characterise each
season!&nbsp; The purple hue which the heath now assumed gave it
a degree of richness that almost exceeded the lustre of the young
green of spring, and harmonised exquisitely with the rays of the
ripening corn.&nbsp; The weather was uninterruptedly fine, and
the people busy in the fields cutting down the corn, or binding
up the sheaves, continually varied the prospect.&nbsp; The rocks,
it is true, were unusually rugged and dreary; yet as the road
runs for a considerable way by the side of a fine river, with
extended pastures on the other side, the image of sterility was
not the predominant object, though the cottages looked still more
miserable, after having seen the Norwegian farms.&nbsp; The trees
likewise appeared of me growth of yesterday, compared with those
Nestors of the forest I have frequently mentioned.&nbsp; The
women and children were cutting off branches from the beech,
birch, oak, &amp;c, and leaving them to dry.&nbsp; This way of
helping out their fodder injures the trees.&nbsp; But the winters
are so long that the poor cannot afford to lay in a sufficient
stock of hay.&nbsp; By such means they just keep life in the poor
cows, for little milk can be expected when they are so miserably
fed.</p>
<p>It was Saturday, and the evening was uncommonly serene.&nbsp;
In the villages I everywhere saw preparations for Sunday; and I
passed by a little car loaded with rye, that presented, for the
pencil and heart, the sweetest picture of a harvest home I had
ever beheld.&nbsp; A little girl was mounted a-straddle on a
shaggy horse, brandishing a stick over its head; the father was
walking at the side of the car with a child in his arms, who must
have come to meet him with tottering steps; the little creature
was stretching out its arms to cling round his neck; and a boy,
just above petticoats, was labouring hard with a fork behind to
keep the sheaves from falling.</p>
<p>My eyes followed them to the cottage, and an involuntary sigh
whispered to my heart that I envied the mother, much as I dislike
cooking, who was preparing their pottage.&nbsp; I was returning
to my babe, who may never experience a father&rsquo;s care or
tenderness.&nbsp; The bosom that nurtured her heaved with a pang
at the thought which only an unhappy mother could feel.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Adieu!</p>
<h2>LETTER XVII.</h2>
<p>I was unwilling to leave Gothenburg without visiting
Trolh&aelig;tt&aelig;.&nbsp; I wished not only to see the
cascade, but to observe the progress of the stupendous attempt to
form a canal through the rocks, to the extent of an English mile
and a half.</p>
<p>This work is carried on by a company, who employ daily nine
hundred men; five years was the time mentioned in the proposals
addressed to the public as necessary for the completion.&nbsp; A
much more considerable sum than the plan requires has been
subscribed, for which there is every reason to suppose the
promoters will receive ample interest.</p>
<p>The Danes survey the progress of this work with a jealous eye,
as it is principally undertaken to get clear of the Sound
duty.</p>
<p>Arrived at Trolh&aelig;tt&aelig;, I must own that the first
view of the cascade disappointed me; and the sight of the works,
as they advanced, though a grand proof of human industry, was not
calculated to warm the fancy.&nbsp; I, however, wandered about;
and at last coming to the conflux of the various cataracts
rushing from different falls, struggling with the huge masses of
rock, and rebounding from the profound cavities, I immediately
retracted, acknowledging that it was indeed a grand object.&nbsp;
A little island stood in the midst, covered with firs, which, by
dividing the torrent, rendered it more picturesque; one half
appearing to issue from a dark cavern, that fancy might easily
imagine a vast fountain throwing up its waters from the very
centre of the earth.</p>
<p>I gazed I know not how long, stunned with the noise, and
growing giddy with only looking at the never-ceasing tumultuous
motion, I listened, scarcely conscious where I was, when I
observed a boy, half obscured by the sparkling foam, fishing
under the impending rock on the other side.&nbsp; How he had
descended I could not perceive; nothing like human footsteps
appeared, and the horrific crags seemed to bid defiance even to
the goat&rsquo;s activity.&nbsp; It looked like an abode only fit
for the eagle, though in its crevices some pines darted up their
spiral heads; but they only grew near the cascade, everywhere
else sterility itself reigned with dreary grandeur; for the huge
grey massy rocks, which probably had been torn asunder by some
dreadful convulsion of nature, had not even their first covering
of a little cleaving moss.&nbsp; There were so many appearances
to excite the idea of chaos, that, instead of admiring the canal
and the works, great as they are termed, and little as they
appear, I could not help regretting that such a noble scene had
not been left in all its solitary sublimity.&nbsp; Amidst the
awful roaring of the impetuous torrents, the noise of human
instruments and the bustle of workmen, even the blowing up of the
rocks when grand masses trembled in the darkened air, only
resembled the insignificant sport of children.</p>
<p>One fall of water, partly made by art, when they were
attempting to construct sluices, had an uncommonly grand effect;
the water precipitated itself with immense velocity down a
perpendicular, at least fifty or sixty yards, into a gulf, so
concealed by the foam as to give full play to the fancy.&nbsp;
There was a continual uproar.&nbsp; I stood on a rock to observe
it, a kind of bridge formed by nature, nearly on a level with the
commencement of the fall.&nbsp; After musing by it a long time I
turned towards the other side, and saw a gentle stream stray
calmly out.&nbsp; I should have concluded that it had no
communication with the torrent had I not seen a huge log that
fell headlong down the cascade steal peacefully into the purling
stream.</p>
<p>I retired from these wild scenes with regret to a miserable
inn, and next morning returned to Gothenburg, to prepare for my
journey to Copenhagen.</p>
<p>I was sorry to leave Gothenburg without travelling farther
into Sweden, yet I imagine I should only have seen a romantic
country thinly inhabited, and these inhabitants struggling with
poverty.&nbsp; The Norwegian peasantry, mostly independent, have
a rough kind of frankness in their manner; but the Swedish,
rendered more abject by misery, have a degree of politeness in
their address which, though it may sometimes border on
insincerity, is oftener the effect of a broken spirit, rather
softened than degraded by wretchedness.</p>
<p>In Norway there are no notes in circulation of less value than
a Swedish rix-dollar.&nbsp; A small silver coin, commonly not
worth more than a penny, and never more than twopence, serves for
change; but in Sweden they have notes as low as sixpence.&nbsp; I
never saw any silver pieces there, and could not without
difficulty, and giving a premium, obtain the value of a
rix-dollar in a large copper coin to give away on the road to the
poor who open the gates.</p>
<p>As another proof of the poverty of Sweden, I ought to mention
that foreign merchants who have acquired a fortune there are
obliged to deposit the sixth part when they leave the
kingdom.&nbsp; This law, you may suppose, is frequently
evaded.</p>
<p>In fact, the laws here, as well as in Norway, are so relaxed
that they rather favour than restrain knavery.</p>
<p>Whilst I was at Gothenburg, a man who had been confined for
breaking open his master&rsquo;s desk and running away with five
or six thousand rix-dollars, was only sentenced to forty
days&rsquo; confinement on bread and water; and this slight
punishment his relations rendered nugatory by supplying him with
more savoury food.</p>
<p>The Swedes are in general attached to their families, yet a
divorce may be obtained by either party on proving the infidelity
of the other or acknowledging it themselves.&nbsp; The women do
not often recur to this equal privilege, for they either
retaliate on their husbands by following their own devices or
sink into the merest domestic drudges, worn down by tyranny to
servile submission.&nbsp; Do not term me severe if I add, that
after youth is flown the husband becomes a sot, and the wife
amuses herself by scolding her servants.&nbsp; In fact, what is
to be expected in any country where taste and cultivation of mind
do not supply the place of youthful beauty and animal
spirits?&nbsp; Affection requires a firmer foundation than
sympathy, and few people have a principle of action sufficiently
stable to produce rectitude of feeling; for in spite of all the
arguments I have heard to justify deviations from duty, I am
persuaded that even the most spontaneous sensations are more
under the direction of principle than weak people are willing to
allow.</p>
<p>But adieu to moralising.&nbsp; I have been writing these last
sheets at an inn in Elsineur, where I am waiting for horses; and
as they are not yet ready, I will give you a short account of my
journey from Gothenburg, for I set out the morning after I
returned from Trolh&aelig;tt&aelig;.</p>
<p>The country during the first day&rsquo;s journey presented a
most barren appearance, as rocky, yet not so picturesque as
Norway, because on a diminutive scale.&nbsp; We stopped to sleep
at a tolerable inn in Falckersberg, a decent little town.</p>
<p>The next day beeches and oaks began to grace the prospects,
the sea every now and then appearing to give them dignity.&nbsp;
I could not avoid observing also, that even in this part of
Sweden, one of the most sterile, as I was informed, there was
more ground under cultivation than in Norway.&nbsp; Plains of
varied crops stretched out to a considerable extent, and sloped
down to the shore, no longer terrific.&nbsp; And, as far as I
could judge, from glancing my eye over the country as we drove
along, agriculture was in a more advanced state, though in the
habitations a greater appearance of poverty still remained.&nbsp;
The cottages, indeed, often looked most uncomfortable, but never
so miserable as those I had remarked on the road to Stromstad,
and the towns were equal, if not superior, to many of the little
towns in Wales, or some I have passed through in my way from
Calais to Paris.</p>
<p>The inns as we advanced were not to be complained of, unless I
had always thought of England.&nbsp; The people were civil, and
much more moderate in their demands than the Norwegians,
particularly to the westward, where they boldly charge for what
you never had, and seem to consider you, as they do a wreck, if
not as lawful prey, yet as a lucky chance, which they ought not
to neglect to seize.</p>
<p>The prospect of Elsineur, as we passed the Sound, was
pleasant.&nbsp; I gave three rix-dollars for my boat, including
something to drink.&nbsp; I mention the sum, because they impose
on strangers.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Adieu! till I arrive at
Copenhagen.</p>
<h2>LETTER XVIII.&mdash;COPENHAGEN.</h2>
<p>The distance from Elsineur to Copenhagen is twenty-two miles;
the road is very good, over a flat country diversified with wood,
mostly beech, and decent mansions.&nbsp; There appeared to be a
great quantity of corn land, and the soil looked much more
fertile than it is in general so near the sea.&nbsp; The rising
grounds, indeed, were very few, and around Copenhagen it is a
perfect plain; of course has nothing to recommend it but
cultivation, not decorations.&nbsp; If I say that the houses did
not disgust me, I tell you all I remember of them, for I cannot
recollect any pleasurable sensations they excited, or that any
object, produced by nature or art, took me out of myself.&nbsp;
The view of the city, as we drew near, was rather grand, but
without any striking feature to interest the imagination,
excepting the trees which shade the footpaths.</p>
<p>Just before I reached Copenhagen I saw a number of tents on a
wide plain, and supposed that the rage for encampments had
reached this city; but I soon discovered that they were the
asylum of many of the poor families who had been driven out of
their habitations by the late fire.</p>
<p>Entering soon after, I passed amongst the dust and rubbish it
had left, affrighted by viewing the extent of the devastation,
for at least a quarter of the city had been destroyed.&nbsp;
There was little in the appearance of fallen bricks and stacks of
chimneys to allure the imagination into soothing melancholy
reveries; nothing to attract the eye of taste, but much to
afflict the benevolent heart.&nbsp; The depredations of time have
always something in them to employ the fancy, or lead to musing
on subjects which, withdrawing the mind from objects of sense,
seem to give it new dignity; but here I was treading on live
ashes.&nbsp; The sufferers were still under the pressure of the
misery occasioned by this dreadful conflagration.&nbsp; I could
not take refuge in the thought: they suffered, but they are no
more! a reflection I frequently summon to calm my mind when
sympathy rises to anguish.&nbsp; I therefore desired the driver
to hasten to the hotel recommended to me, that I might avert my
eyes and snap the train of thinking which had sent me into all
the corners of the city in search of houseless heads.</p>
<p>This morning I have been walking round the town, till I am
weary of observing the ravages.&nbsp; I had often heard the
Danes, even those who had seen Paris and London, speak of
Copenhagen with rapture.&nbsp; Certainly I have seen it in a very
disadvantageous light, some of the best streets having been
burnt, and the whole place thrown into confusion.&nbsp; Still the
utmost that can, or could ever, I believe, have been said in its
praise, might be comprised in a few words.&nbsp; The streets are
open, and many of the houses large; but I saw nothing to rouse
the idea of elegance or grandeur, if I except the circus where
the king and prince royal reside.</p>
<p>The palace, which was consumed about two years ago, must have
been a handsome, spacious building; the stone-work is still
standing, and a great number of the poor, during the late fire,
took refuge in its ruins till they could find some other
abode.&nbsp; Beds were thrown on the landing-places of the grand
staircase, where whole families crept from the cold, and every
little nook is boarded up as a retreat for some poor creatures
deprived of their home.&nbsp; At present a roof may be sufficient
to shelter them from the night air; but as the season advances,
the extent of the calamity will be more severely felt, I fear,
though the exertions on the part of Government are very
considerable.&nbsp; Private charity has also, no doubt, done much
to alleviate the misery which obtrudes itself at every turn;
still, public spirit appears to me to be hardly alive here.&nbsp;
Had it existed, the conflagration might have been smothered in
the beginning, as it was at last, by tearing down several houses
before the flames had reached them.&nbsp; To this the inhabitants
would not consent; and the prince royal not having sufficient
energy of character to know when he ought to be absolute, calmly
let them pursue their own course, till the whole city seemed to
be threatened with destruction.&nbsp; Adhering, with puerile
scrupulosity, to the law which he has imposed on himself, of
acting exactly right, he did wrong by idly lamenting whilst he
marked the progress of a mischief that one decided step would
have stopped.&nbsp; He was afterwards obliged to resort to
violent measures; but then, who could blame him?&nbsp; And, to
avoid censure, what sacrifices are not made by weak minds?</p>
<p>A gentleman who was a witness of the scene assured me,
likewise, that if the people of property had taken half as much
pains to extinguish the fire as to preserve their valuables and
furniture, it would soon have been got under.&nbsp; But they who
were not immediately in danger did not exert themselves
sufficiently, till fear, like an electrical shock, roused all the
inhabitants to a sense of the general evil.&nbsp; Even the
fire-engines were out of order, though the burning of the palace
ought to have admonished them of the necessity of keeping them in
constant repair.&nbsp; But this kind of indolence respecting what
does not immediately concern them seems to characterise the
Danes.&nbsp; A sluggish concentration in themselves makes them so
careful to preserve their property, that they will not venture on
any enterprise to increase it in which there is a shadow of
hazard.</p>
<p>Considering Copenhagen as the capital of Denmark and Norway, I
was surprised not to see so much industry or taste as in
Christiania.&nbsp; Indeed, from everything I have had an
opportunity of observing, the Danes are the people who have made
the fewest sacrifices to the graces.</p>
<p>The men of business are domestic tyrants, coldly immersed in
their own affairs, and so ignorant of the state of other
countries, that they dogmatically assert that Denmark is the
happiest country in the world; the Prince Royal the best of all
possible princes; and Count Bernstorff the wisest of
ministers.</p>
<p>As for the women, they are simply notable housewives; without
accomplishments or any of the charms that adorn more advanced
social life.&nbsp; This total ignorance may enable them to save
something in their kitchens, but it is far from rendering them
better parents.&nbsp; On the contrary, the children are spoiled,
as they usually are when left to the care of weak, indulgent
mothers, who having no principle of action to regulate their
feelings, become the slaves of infants, enfeebling both body and
mind by false tenderness.</p>
<p>I am, perhaps, a little prejudiced, as I write from the
impression of the moment; for I have been tormented to-day by the
presence of unruly children, and made angry by some invectives
thrown out against the maternal character of the unfortunate
Matilda.&nbsp; She was censured, with the most cruel insinuation,
for her management of her son, though, from what I could gather,
she gave proofs of good sense as well as tenderness in her
attention to him.&nbsp; She used to bathe him herself every
morning; insisted on his being loosely clad; and would not permit
his attendants to injure his digestion by humouring his
appetite.&nbsp; She was equally careful to prevent his acquiring
haughty airs, and playing the tyrant in leading-strings.&nbsp;
The Queen Dowager would not permit her to suckle him; but the
next child being a daughter, and not the Heir-Apparent of the
Crown, less opposition was made to her discharging the duty of a
mother.</p>
<p>Poor Matilda! thou hast haunted me ever since may arrival; and
the view I have had of the manners of the country, exciting my
sympathy, has increased my respect for thy memory.</p>
<p>I am now fully convinced that she was the victim of the party
she displaced, who would have overlooked or encouraged her
attachment, had not her lover, aiming at being useful, attempted
to overturn some established abuses before the people, ripe for
the change, had sufficient spirit to support him when struggling
in their behalf.&nbsp; Such indeed was the asperity sharpened
against her that I have heard her, even after so many years have
elapsed, charged with licentiousness, not only for endeavouring
to render the public amusements more elegant, but for her very
charities, because she erected, amongst other institutions, a
hospital to receive foundlings.&nbsp; Disgusted with many customs
which pass for virtues, though they are nothing more than
observances of forms, often at the expense of truth, she probably
ran into an error common to innovators, in wishing to do
immediately what can only be done by time.</p>
<p>Many very cogent reasons have been urged by her friends to
prove that her affection for Struensee was never carried to the
length alleged against her by those who feared her
influence.&nbsp; Be that as it may she certainly was no a woman
of gallantry, and if she had an attachment for him it did not
disgrace her heart or understanding, the king being a notorious
debauchee and an idiot into the bargain.&nbsp; As the
king&rsquo;s conduct had always been directed by some favourite,
they also endeavoured to govern him, from a principle of
self-preservation as well as a laudable ambition; but, not aware
of the prejudices they had to encounter, the system they adopted
displayed more benevolence of heart than soundness of
judgment.&nbsp; As to the charge, still believed, of their giving
the King drugs to injure his faculties, it is too absurd to be
refuted.&nbsp; Their oppressors had better have accused them of
dabbling in the black art, for the potent spell still keeps his
wits in bondage.</p>
<p>I cannot describe to you the effect it had on me to see this
puppet of a monarch moved by the strings which Count Bernstorff
holds fast; sit, with vacant eye, erect, receiving the homage of
courtiers who mock him with a show of respect.&nbsp; He is, in
fact, merely a machine of state, to subscribe the name of a king
to the acts of the Government, which, to avoid danger, have no
value unless countersigned by the Prince Royal; for he is allowed
to be absolutely aim idiot, excepting that now and then an
observation or trick escapes him, which looks more like madness
than imbecility.</p>
<p>What a farce is life.&nbsp; This effigy of majesty is allowed
to burn down to the socket, whilst the hapless Matilda was
hurried into an untimely grave.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;As flies to wanton boys, are we to the
gods;<br />
They kill us for their sport.&rdquo;</p>

<p style="text-align: right">Adieu!</p>
<h2>LETTER XIX.</h2>
<p>Business having obliged me to go a few miles out of town this
morning I was surprised at meeting a crowd of people of every
description, and inquiring the cause of a servant, who spoke
French, I was informed that a man had been executed two hours
before, and the body afterwards burnt.&nbsp; I could not help
looking with horror around&mdash;the fields lost their
verdure&mdash;and I turned with disgust from the well-dressed
women who were returning with their children from this
sight.&nbsp; What a spectacle for humanity!&nbsp; The seeing such
a flock of idle gazers plunged me into a train of reflections on
the pernicious effects produced by false notions of
justice.&nbsp; And I am persuaded that till capital punishments
are entirely abolished executions ought to have every appearance
of horror given to them, instead of being, as they are now, a
scene of amusement for the gaping crowd, where sympathy is
quickly effaced by curiosity.</p>
<p>I have always been of opinion that the allowing actors to die
in the presence of the audience has an immoral tendency, but
trifling when compared with the ferocity acquired by viewing the
reality as a show; for it seems to me that in all countries the
common people go to executions to see how the poor wretch plays
his part, rather than to commiserate his fate, much less to think
of the breach of morality which has brought him to such a
deplorable end.&nbsp; Consequently executions, far from being
useful examples to the survivors, have, I am persuaded, a quite
contrary effect, by hardening the heart they ought to
terrify.&nbsp; Besides the fear of an ignominious death, I
believe, never deferred anyone from the commission of a crime,
because, in committing it, the mind is roused to activity about
present circumstances.&nbsp; It is a game at hazard, at which all
expect the turn of the die in their own favour, never reflecting
on the chance of ruin till it comes.&nbsp; In fact, from what I
saw in the fortresses of Norway, I am more and more convinced
that the same energy of character which renders a man a daring
villain would have rendered him useful to society, had that
society been well organised.&nbsp; When a strong mind is not
disciplined by cultivation it is a sense of injustice that
renders it unjust.</p>
<p>Executions, however, occur very rarely at Copenhagen; for
timidity, rather than clemency, palsies all the operations of the
present Government.&nbsp; The malefactor who died this morning
would not, probably, have been punished with death at any other
period; but an incendiary excites universal execration; and as
the greater part of the inhabitants are still distressed by the
late conflagration, an example was thought absolutely necessary;
though, from what I can gather, the fire was accidental.</p>
<p>Not, but that I have very seriously been informed, that
combustible materials were placed at proper distance, by the
emissaries of Mr. Pitt; and, to corroborate the fact, many people
insist that the flames burst out at once in different parts of
the city; not allowing the wind to have any hand in it.&nbsp; So
much for the plot.&nbsp; But the fabricators of plots in all
countries build their conjectures on the &ldquo;baseless fabric
of a vision;&rdquo; and it seems even a sort of poetical justice,
that whilst this Minister is crushing at home plots of his own
conjuring up, on the Continent, and in the north, he should, with
as little foundation, be accused of wishing to set the world on
fire.</p>
<p>I forgot to mention to you, that I was informed, by a man of
veracity, that two persons came to the stake to drink a glass of
the criminal&rsquo;s blood, as an infallible remedy for the
apoplexy.&nbsp; And when I animadverted in the company, where it
was mentioned, on such a horrible violation of nature, a Danish
lady reproved me very severely, asking how I knew that it was not
a cure for the disease? adding, that every attempt was
justifiable in search of health.&nbsp; I did not, you may
imagine, enter into an argument with a person the slave of such a
gross prejudice.&nbsp; And I allude to it not only as a trait of
the ignorance of the people, but to censure the Government for
not preventing scenes that throw an odium on the human race.</p>
<p>Empiricism is not peculiar to Denmark; and I know no way of
rooting it out, though it be a remnant of exploded witchcraft,
till the acquiring a general knowledge of the component parts of
the human frame becomes a part of public education.</p>
<p>Since the fire, the inhabitants have been very assiduously
employed in searching for property secreted during the confusion;
and it is astonishing how many people, formerly termed reputable,
had availed themselves of the common calamity to purloin what the
flames spared.&nbsp; Others, expert at making a distinction
without a difference, concealed what they found, not troubling
themselves to inquire for the owners, though they scrupled to
search for plunder anywhere, but amongst the ruins.</p>
<p>To be honester than the laws require is by most people thought
a work of supererogation; and to slip through the grate of the
law has ever exercised the abilities of adventurers, who wish to
get rich the shortest way.&nbsp; Knavery without personal danger
is an art brought to great perfection by the statesman and
swindler; and meaner knaves are not tardy in following their
footsteps.</p>
<p>It moves my gall to discover some of the commercial frauds
practised during the present war.&nbsp; In short, under whatever
point of view I consider society, it appears to me that an
adoration of property is the root of all evil.&nbsp; Here it does
not render the people enterprising, as in America, but thrifty
and cautious.&nbsp; I never, therefore, was in a capital where
there was so little appearance of active industry; and as for
gaiety, I looked in vain for the sprightly gait of the
Norwegians, who in every respect appear to me to have got the
start of them.&nbsp; This difference I attribute to their having
more liberty&mdash;a liberty which they think their right by
inheritance, whilst the Danes, when they boast of their negative
happiness, always mention it as the boon of the Prince Royal,
under the superintending wisdom of Count Bernstorff.&nbsp;
Vassalage is nevertheless ceasing throughout the kingdom, and
with it will pass away that sordid avarice which every
modification of slavery is calculated to produce.</p>
<p>If the chief use of property be power, in the shape of the
respect it procures, is it not among the inconsistencies of human
nature most incomprehensible, that men should find a pleasure in
hoarding up property which they steal from their necessities,
even when they are convinced that it would be dangerous to
display such an enviable superiority?&nbsp; Is not this the
situation of serfs in every country.&nbsp; Yet a rapacity to
accumulate money seems to become stronger in proportion as it is
allowed to be useless.</p>
<p>Wealth does not appear to be sought for amongst the Danes, to
obtain the excellent luxuries of life, for a want of taste is
very conspicuous at Copenhagen; so much so that I am not
surprised to hear that poor Matilda offended the rigid Lutherans
by aiming to refine their pleasures.&nbsp; The elegance which she
wished to introduce was termed lasciviousness; yet I do not find
that the absence of gallantry renders the wives more chaste, or
the husbands more constant.&nbsp; Love here seems to corrupt the
morals without polishing the manners, by banishing confidence and
truth, the charm as well as cement of domestic life.&nbsp; A
gentleman, who has resided in this city some time, assures me
that he could not find language to give me an idea of the gross
debaucheries into which the lower order of people fall; and the
promiscuous amours of the men of the middling class with their
female servants debase both beyond measure, weakening every
species of family affection.</p>
<p>I have everywhere been struck by one characteristic difference
in the conduct of the two sexes; women, in general, are seduced
by their superiors, and men jilted by their inferiors: rank and
manners awe the one, and cunning and wantonness subjugate the
other; ambition creeping into the woman&rsquo;s passion, and
tyranny giving force to the man&rsquo;s, for most men treat their
mistresses as kings do their favourites: <i>ergo</i> is not man
then the tyrant of the creation?</p>
<p>Still harping on the same subject, you will exclaim&mdash;How
can I avoid it, when most of the struggles of an eventful life
have been occasioned by the oppressed state of my sex?&nbsp; We
reason deeply when we feel forcibly.</p>
<p>But to return to the straight road of observation.&nbsp; The
sensuality so prevalent appears to me to arise rather from
indolence of mind and dull senses, than from an exuberance of
life, which often fructifies the whole character when the
vivacity of youthful spirits begins to subside into strength of
mind.</p>
<p>I have before mentioned that the men are domestic tyrants,
considering them as fathers, brothers, or husbands; but there is
a kind of interregnum between the reign of the father and husband
which is the only period of freedom and pleasure that the women
enjoy.&nbsp; Young people who are attached to each other, with
the consent of their friends, exchange rings, and are permitted
to enjoy a degree of liberty together which I have never noticed
in any other country.&nbsp; The days of courtship are, therefore,
prolonged till it be perfectly convenient to marry: the intimacy
often becomes very tender; and if the lover obtain the privilege
of a husband, it can only be termed half by stealth, because the
family is wilfully blind.&nbsp; It happens very rarely that these
honorary engagements are dissolved or disregarded, a stigma being
attached to a breach of faith which is thought more disgraceful,
if not so criminal, as the violation of the marriage-vow.</p>
<p>Do not forget that, in my general observations, I do not
pretend to sketch a national character, but merely to note the
present state of morals and manners as I trace the progress of
the world&rsquo;s improvement.&nbsp; Because, during my residence
in different countries, my principal object has been to take such
a dispassionate view of men as will lead me to form a just idea
of the nature of man.&nbsp; And, to deal ingenuously with you, I
believe I should have been less severe in the remarks I have made
on the vanity and depravity of the French, had I travelled
towards the north before I visited France.</p>
<p>The interesting picture frequently drawn of the virtues of a
rising people has, I fear, been fallacious, excepting the
accounts of the enthusiasm which various public struggles have
produced.&nbsp; We talk of the depravity of the French, and lay a
stress on the old age of the nation; yet where has more virtuous
enthusiasm been displayed than during the two last years by the
common people of France, and in their armies?&nbsp; I am obliged
sometimes to recollect the numberless instances which I have
either witnessed, or heard well authenticated, to balance the
account of horrors, alas! but too true.&nbsp; I am, therefore,
inclined to believe that the gross vices which I have always seem
allied with simplicity of manners, are the concomitants of
ignorance.</p>
<p>What, for example, has piety, under the heathen or Christian
system, been, but a blind faith in things contrary to the
principles of reason?&nbsp; And could poor reason make
considerable advances when it was reckoned the highest degree of
virtue to do violence to its dictates?&nbsp; Lutherans, preaching
reformation, have built a reputation for sanctity on the same
foundation as the Catholics; yet I do not perceive that a regular
attendance on public worship, and their other observances, make
them a whit more true in their affections, or honest in their
private transactions.&nbsp; It seems, indeed, quite as easy to
prevaricate with religious injunctions as human laws, when the
exercise of their reason does not lead people to acquire
principles for themselves to be the criterion of all those they
receive from others.</p>
<p>If travelling, as the completion of a liberal education, were
to be adopted on rational grounds, the northern states ought to
be visited before the more polished parts of Europe, to serve as
the elements even of the knowledge of manners, only to be
acquired by tracing the various shades in different
countries.&nbsp; But, when visiting distant climes, a momentary
social sympathy should not be allowed to influence the
conclusions of the understanding, for hospitality too frequently
leads travellers, especially those who travel in search of
pleasure, to make a false estimate of the virtues of a nation,
which, I am now convinced, bear an exact proportion to their
scientific improvements.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Adieu.</p>
<h2>LETTER XX.</h2>
<p>I have formerly censured the French for their extreme
attachment to theatrical exhibitions, because I thought that they
tended to render them vain and unnatural characters; but I must
acknowledge, especially as women of the town never appear in the
Parisian as at our theatres, that the little saving of the week
is more usefully expended there every Sunday than in porter or
brandy, to intoxicate or stupify the mind.&nbsp; The common
people of France have a great superiority over that class in
every other country on this very score.&nbsp; It is merely the
sobriety of the Parisians which renders their f&ecirc;tes more
interesting, their gaiety never becoming disgusting or dangerous,
as is always the case when liquor circulates.&nbsp; Intoxication
is the pleasure of savages, and of all those whose employments
rather exhaust their animal spirits than exercise their
faculties.&nbsp; Is not this, in fact, the vice, both in England
and the northern states of Europe, which appears to be the
greatest impediment to general improvement?&nbsp; Drinking is
here the principal relaxation of the men, including smoking, but
the women are very abstemious, though they have no public
amusements as a substitute.&nbsp; I ought to except one theatre,
which appears more than is necessary; for when I was there it was
not half full, and neither the ladies nor actresses displayed
much fancy in their dress.</p>
<p>The play was founded on the story of the &ldquo;Mock
Doctor;&rdquo; and, from the gestures of the servants, who were
the best actors, I should imagine contained some humour.&nbsp;
The farce, termed ballet, was a kind of pantomime, the childish
incidents of which were sufficient to show the state of the
dramatic art in Denmark, and the gross taste of the
audience.&nbsp; A magician, in the disguise of a tinker, enters a
cottage where the women are all busy ironing, and rubs a dirty
frying-pan against the linen.&nbsp; The women raise a
hue-and-cry, and dance after him, rousing their husbands, who
join in the dance, but get the start of them in the
pursuit.&nbsp; The tinker, with the frying-pan for a shield,
renders them immovable, and blacks their cheeks.&nbsp; Each
laughs at the other, unconscious of his own appearance; meanwhile
the women enter to enjoy the sport, &ldquo;the rare fun,&rdquo;
with other incidents of the same species.</p>
<p>The singing was much on a par with the dancing, the one as
destitute of grace as the other of expression; but the orchestra
was well filled, the instrumental being far superior to the vocal
music.</p>
<p>I have likewise visited the public library and museum, as well
as the palace of Rosembourg.&nbsp; This palace, now deserted,
displays a gloomy kind of grandeur throughout, for the silence of
spacious apartments always makes itself to be felt; I at least
feel it, and I listen for the sound of my footsteps as I have
done at midnight to the ticking of the death-watch, encouraging a
kind of fanciful superstition.&nbsp; Every object carried me back
to past times, and impressed the manners of the age forcibly on
my mind.&nbsp; In this point of view the preservation of old
palaces and their tarnished furniture is useful, for they may be
considered as historical documents.</p>
<p>The vacuum left by departed greatness was everywhere
observable, whilst the battles and processions portrayed on the
walls told you who had here excited revelry after retiring from
slaughter, or dismissed pageantry in search of pleasure.&nbsp; It
seemed a vast tomb full of the shadowy phantoms of those who had
played or toiled their hour out and sunk behind the tapestry
which celebrated the conquests of love or war.&nbsp; Could they
be no more&mdash;to whom my imagination thus gave life?&nbsp;
Could the thoughts, of which there remained so many vestiges,
have vanished quite away?&nbsp; And these beings, composed of
such noble materials of thinking and feeling, have they only
melted into the elements to keep in motion the grand mass of
life?&nbsp; It cannot be!&mdash;as easily could I believe that
the large silver lions at the top of the banqueting room thought
and reasoned.&nbsp; But avaunt! ye waking dreams! yet I cannot
describe the curiosities to you.</p>
<p>There were cabinets full of baubles and gems, and swords which
must have been wielded by giant&rsquo;s hand.&nbsp; The
coronation ornaments wait quietly here till wanted, and the
wardrobe exhibits the vestments which formerly graced these
shows.&nbsp; It is a pity they do not lend them to the actors,
instead of allowing them to perish ingloriously.</p>
<p>I have not visited any other palace, excepting Hirsholm, the
gardens of which are laid out with taste, and command the finest
views the country affords.&nbsp; As they are in the modern and
English style, I thought I was following the footsteps of
Matilda, who wished to multiply around her the images of her
beloved country.&nbsp; I was also gratified by the sight of a
Norwegian landscape in miniature, which with great propriety
makes a part of the Danish King&rsquo;s garden.&nbsp; The cottage
is well imitated, and the whole has a pleasing effect,
particularly so to me who love Norway&mdash;its peaceful farms
and spacious wilds.</p>
<p>The public library consists of a collection much larger than I
expected to see; and it is well arranged.&nbsp; Of the value of
the Icelandic manuscripts I could not form a judgment, though the
alphabet of some of them amused me, by showing what immense
labour men will submit to, in order to transmit their ideas to
posterity.&nbsp; I have sometimes thought it a great misfortune
for individuals to acquire a certain delicacy of sentiment, which
often makes them weary of the common occurrences of life; yet it
is this very delicacy of feeling and thinking which probably has
produced most of the performances that have benefited
mankind.&nbsp; It might with propriety, perhaps, be termed the
malady of genius; the cause of that characteristic melancholy
which &ldquo;grows with its growth, and strengthens with its
strength.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are some good pictures in the royal museum.&nbsp; Do not
start, I am not going to trouble you with a dull catalogue, or
stupid criticisms on masters to whom time has assigned their just
niche in the temple of fame; had there been any by living artists
of this country, I should have noticed them, as making a part of
the sketches I am drawing of the present state of the
place.&nbsp; The good pictures were mixed indiscriminately with
the bad ones, in order to assort the frames.&nbsp; The same fault
is conspicuous in the new splendid gallery forming at Paris;
though it seems an obvious thought that a school for artists
ought to be arranged in such a manner, as to show the progressive
discoveries and improvements in the art.</p>
<p>A collection of the dresses, arms, and implements of the
Laplanders attracted my attention, displaying that first species
of ingenuity which is rather a proof of patient perseverance,
than comprehension of mind.&nbsp; The specimens of natural
history, and curiosities of art, were likewise huddled together
without that scientific order which alone renders them useful;
but this may partly have been occasioned by the hasty manner in
which they were removed from the palace when in flames.</p>
<p>There are some respectable men of science here, but few
literary characters, and fewer artists.&nbsp; They want
encouragement, and will continue, I fear, from the present
appearance of things, to languish unnoticed a long time; for
neither the vanity of wealth, nor the enterprising spirit of
commerce, has yet thrown a glance that way.</p>
<p>Besides, the Prince Royal, determined to be economical, almost
descends to parsimony; and perhaps depresses his subjects, by
labouring not to oppress them; for his intentions always seem to
be good&mdash;yet nothing can give a more forcible idea of the
dulness which eats away all activity of mind, than the insipid
routine of a court, without magnificence or elegance.</p>
<p>The Prince, from what I can now collect, has very moderate
abilities; yet is so well disposed, that Count Bernstorff finds
him as tractable as he could wish; for I consider the Count as
the real sovereign, scarcely behind the curtain; the Prince
having none of that obstinate self-sufficiency of youth, so often
the forerunner of decision of character.&nbsp; He and the
Princess his wife, dine every day with the King, to save the
expense of two tables.&nbsp; What a mummery it must be to treat
as a king a being who has lost the majesty of man!&nbsp; But even
Count Bernstorff&rsquo;s morality submits to this standing
imposition; and he avails himself of it sometimes, to soften a
refusal of his own, by saying it is the <i>will</i> of the King,
my master, when everybody knows that he has neither will nor
memory.&nbsp; Much the same use is made of him as, I have
observed, some termagant wives make of their husbands; they would
dwell on the necessity of obeying their husbands, poor passive
souls, who never were allowed <i>to will</i>, when they wanted to
conceal their own tyranny.</p>
<p>A story is told here of the King&rsquo;s formerly making a dog
counsellor of state, because when the dog, accustomed to eat at
the royal table, snatched a piece of meat off an old
officer&rsquo;s plate, he reproved him jocosely, saying that he,
<i>monsieur le chien</i>, had not the privilege of dining with
his majesty, a privilege annexed to this distinction.</p>
<p>The burning of the palace was, in fact, a fortunate
circumstance, as it afforded a pretext for reducing the
establishment of the household, which was far too great for the
revenue of the Crown.&nbsp; The Prince Royal, at present, runs
into the opposite extreme; and the formality, if not the
parsimony, of the court, seems to extend to all the other
branches of society, which I had an opportunity of observing;
though hospitality still characterises their intercourse with
strangers.</p>
<p>But let me now stop; I may be a little partial, and view
everything with the jaundiced eye of melancholy&mdash;for I am
sad&mdash;and have cause.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">God bless you!</p>
<h2>LETTER XXI.</h2>
<p>I have seen Count Bernstorff; and his conversation confirms me
in the opinion I had previously formed of him; I mean, since my
arrival at Copenhagen.&nbsp; He is a worthy man, a little vain of
his virtue <i>&agrave; la</i> Necker; and more anxious not to do
wrong, that is to avoid blame, than desirous of doing good;
especially if any particular good demands a change.&nbsp;
Prudence, in short, seems to be the basis of his character; and,
from the tenor of the Government, I should think inclining to
that cautious circumspection which treads on the heels of
timidity.&nbsp; He has considerable information, and some
finesse; or he could not be a Minister.&nbsp; Determined not to
risk his popularity, for he is tenderly careful of his
reputation, he will never gloriously fail like Struensee, or
disturb, with the energy of genius, the stagnant state of the
public mind.</p>
<p>I suppose that Lavater, whom he invited to visit him two years
ago&mdash;some say to fix the principles of the Christian
religion firmly in the Prince Royal&rsquo;s mind, found lines in
his face to prove him a statesman of the first order; because he
has a knack at seeing a great character in the countenances of
men in exalted stations, who have noticed him or his works.&nbsp;
Besides, the Count&rsquo;s sentiments relative to the French
Revolution, agreeing with Lavater&rsquo;s, must have ensured his
applause.</p>
<p>The Danes, in general, seem extremely averse to innovation,
and if happiness only consist in opinion, they are the happiest
people in the world; for I never saw any so well satisfied with
their own situation.&nbsp; Yet the climate appears to be very
disagreeable, the weather being dry and sultry, or moist and
cold; the atmosphere never having that sharp, bracing purity,
which in Norway prepares you to brave its rigours.&nbsp; I do not
hear the inhabitants of this place talk with delight of the
winter, which is the constant theme of the Norwegians; on the
contrary, they seem to dread its comfortless inclemency.</p>
<p>The ramparts are pleasant, and must have been much more so
before the fire, the walkers not being annoyed by the clouds of
dust which, at present, the slightest wind wafts from the
ruins.&nbsp; The windmills, and the comfortable houses
contiguous, belonging to the millers, as well as the appearance
of the spacious barracks for the soldiers and sailors, tend to
render this walk more agreeable.&nbsp; The view of the country
has not much to recommend it to notice but its extent and
cultivation: yet as the eye always delights to dwell on verdant
plains, especially when we are resident in a great city, these
shady walks should be reckoned amongst the advantages procured by
the Government for the inhabitants.&nbsp; I like them better than
the Royal Gardens, also open to the public, because the latter
seem sunk in the heart of the city, to concentrate its fogs.</p>
<p>The canals which intersect the streets are equally convenient
and wholesome; but the view of the sea commanded by the town had
little to interest me whilst the remembrance of the various bold
and picturesque shores I had seen was fresh in my memory.&nbsp;
Still the opulent inhabitants, who seldom go abroad, must find
the spots were they fix their country seats much pleasanter on
account of the vicinity of the ocean.</p>
<p>One of the best streets in Copenhagen is almost filled with
hospitals, erected by the Government, and, I am assured, as well
regulated as institutions of this kind are in any country; but
whether hospitals or workhouses are anywhere superintended with
sufficient humanity I have frequently had reason to doubt.</p>
<p>The autumn is so uncommonly fine that I am unwilling to put
off my journey to Hamburg much longer, lest the weather should
alter suddenly, and the chilly harbingers of winter catch me
here, where I have nothing now to detain me but the hospitality
of the families to whom I had recommendatory letters.&nbsp; I
lodged at an hotel situated in a large open square, where the
troops exercise and the market is kept.&nbsp; My apartments were
very good; and on account of the fire I was told that I should be
charged very high; yet, paying my bill just now, I find the
demands much lower in proportion than in Norway, though my
dinners were in every respect better.</p>
<p>I have remained more at home since I arrived at Copenhagen
than I ought to have done in a strange place, but the mind is not
always equally active in search of information, and my oppressed
heart too often sighs out&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;How dull, flat, and unprofitable<br />
Are to me all the usages of this world:<br />
That it should come to this!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Farewell!&nbsp; Fare thee well, I say; if thou canst, repeat
the adieu in a different tone.</p>
<h2>LETTER XXII.</h2>
<p>I arrived at Corsoer the night after I quitted Copenhagen,
purposing to take my passage across the Great Belt the next
morning, though the weather was rather boisterous.&nbsp; It is
about four-and-twenty miles but as both I and my little girl are
never attacked by sea-sickness&mdash;though who can avoid
<i>ennui</i>?&mdash;I enter a boat with the same indifference as
I change horses; and as for danger, come when it may, I dread it
not sufficiently to have any anticipating fears.</p>
<p>The road from Copenhagen was very good, through an open, flat
country that had little to recommend it to notice excepting the
cultivation, which gratified my heart more than my eye.</p>
<p>I took a barge with a German baron who was hastening back from
a tour into Denmark, alarmed by the intelligence of the French
having passed the Rhine.&nbsp; His conversation beguiled the
time, and gave a sort of stimulus to my spirits, which had been
growing more and more languid ever since my return to Gothenburg;
you know why.&nbsp; I had often endeavoured to rouse myself to
observation by reflecting that I was passing through scenes which
I should probably never see again, and consequently ought not to
omit observing.&nbsp; Still I fell into reveries, thinking, by
way of excuse, that enlargement of mind and refined feelings are
of little use but to barb the arrows of sorrow which waylay us
everywhere, eluding the sagacity of wisdom and rendering
principles unavailing, if considered as a breastwork to secure
our own hearts.</p>
<p>Though we had not a direct wind, we were not detained more
than three hours and a half on the water, just long enough to
give us an appetite for our dinner.</p>
<p>We travelled the remainder of the day and the following night
in company with the same party, the German gentleman whom I have
mentioned, his friend, and servant.&nbsp; The meetings at the
post-houses were pleasant to me, who usually heard nothing but
strange tongues around me.&nbsp; Marguerite and the child often
fell asleep, and when they were awake I might still reckon myself
alone, as our train of thoughts had nothing in common.&nbsp;
Marguerite, it is true, was much amused by the costume of the
women, particularly by the pannier which adorned both their heads
and tails, and with great glee recounted to me the stories she
had treasured up for her family when once more within the
barriers of dear Paris, not forgetting, with that arch, agreeable
vanity peculiar to the French, which they exhibit whilst half
ridiculing it, to remind me of the importance she should assume
when she informed her friends of all her journeys by sea and
land, showing the pieces of money she had collected, and
stammering out a few foreign phrases, which she repeated in a
true Parisian accent.&nbsp; Happy thoughtlessness! ay, and
enviable harmless vanity, which thus produced a <i>gait&eacute;
du coeur</i> worth all my philosophy!</p>
<p>The man I had hired at Copenhagen advised me to go round about
twenty miles to avoid passing the Little Belt excepting by a
ferry, as the wind was contrary.&nbsp; But the gentlemen
overruled his arguments, which we were all very sorry for
afterwards, when we found ourselves becalmed on the Little Belt
ten hours, tacking about without ceasing, to gain the shore.</p>
<p>An oversight likewise made the passage appear much more
tedious, nay, almost insupportable.&nbsp; When I went on board at
the Great Belt, I had provided refreshments in case of detention,
which remaining untouched I thought not then any such precaution
necessary for the second passage, misled by the epithet of
&ldquo;little,&rdquo; though I have since been informed that it
is frequently the longest.&nbsp; This mistake occasioned much
vexation; for the child, at last, began to cry so bitterly for
bread, that fancy conjured up before me the wretched Ugolino,
with his famished children; and I, literally speaking, enveloped
myself in sympathetic horrors, augmented by every fear my babe
shed, from which I could not escape till we landed, and a
luncheon of bread and basin of milk routed the spectres of
fancy.</p>
<p>I then supped with my companions, with whom I was soon after
to part for ever&mdash;always a most melancholy death-like
idea&mdash;a sort of separation of soul; for all the regret which
follows those from whom fate separates us seems to be something
torn from ourselves.&nbsp; These were strangers I remember; yet
when there is any originality in a countenance, it takes its
place in our memory, and we are sorry to lose an acquaintance the
moment he begins to interest us, through picked up on the
highway.&nbsp; There was, in fact, a degree of intelligence, and
still more sensibility, in the features and conversation of one
of the gentlemen, that made me regret the loss of his society
during the rest of the journey; for he was compelled to travel
post, by his desire to reach his estate before the arrival of the
French.</p>
<p>This was a comfortable inn, as were several others I stopped
at; but the heavy sandy roads were very fatiguing, after the fine
ones we had lately skimmed over both in Sweden and Denmark.&nbsp;
The country resembled the most open part of England&mdash;laid
out for corn rather than grazing.&nbsp; It was pleasant, yet
there was little in the prospects to awaken curiosity, by
displaying the peculiar characteristics of a new country, which
had so frequently stole me from myself in Norway.&nbsp; We often
passed over large unenclosed tracts, not graced with trees, or at
least very sparingly enlivened by them, and the half-formed roads
seemed to demand the landmarks, set up in the waste, to prevent
the traveller from straying far out of his way, and plodding
through the wearisome sand.</p>
<p>The heaths were dreary, and had none of the wild charms of
those of Sweden and Norway to cheat time; neither the terrific
rocks, nor smiling herbage grateful to the sight and scented from
afar, made us forget their length.&nbsp; Still the country
appeared much more populous, and the towns, if not the
farmhouses, were superior to those of Norway.&nbsp; I even
thought that the inhabitants of the former had more
intelligence&mdash;at least, I am sure they had more vivacity in
their countenances than I had seen during my northern tour: their
senses seemed awake to business and pleasure.&nbsp; I was
therefore gratified by hearing once more the busy hum of
industrious men in the day, and the exhilarating sounds of joy in
the evening; for, as the weather was still fine, the women and
children were amusing themselves at their doors, or walking under
the trees, which in many places were planted in the streets; and
as most of the towns of any note were situated on little bays or
branches of the Baltic, their appearance as we approached was
often very picturesque, and, when we entered, displayed the
comfort and cleanliness of easy, if not the elegance of opulent,
circumstances.&nbsp; But the cheerfulness of the people in the
streets was particularly grateful to me, after having been
depressed by the deathlike silence of those of Denmark, where
every house made me think of a tomb.&nbsp; The dress of the
peasantry is suited to the climate; in short, none of that
poverty and dirt appeared, at the sight of which the heart
sickens.</p>
<p>As I only stopped to change horses, take refreshment, and
sleep, I had not an opportunity of knowing more of the country
than conclusions which the information gathered by my eyes
enabled me to draw, and that was sufficient to convince me that I
should much rather have lived in some of the towns I now pass
through than in any I had seen in Sweden or Denmark.&nbsp; The
people struck me as having arrived at that period when the
faculties will unfold themselves; in short; they look alive to
improvement, neither congealed by indolence, nor bent down by
wretchedness to servility.</p>
<p>From the previous impression&mdash;I scarcely can trace whence
I received it&mdash;I was agreeably surprised to perceive such an
appearance of comfort in this part of Germany.&nbsp; I had formed
a conception of the tyranny of the petty potentates that had
thrown a gloomy veil over the face of the whole country in my
imagination, that cleared away like the darkness of night before
the sun as I saw the reality.&nbsp; I should probably have
discovered much lurking misery, the consequence of ignorant
oppression, no doubt, had I had time to inquire into particulars;
but it did not stalk abroad and infect the surface over which my
eye glanced.&nbsp; Yes, I am persuaded that a considerable degree
of general knowledge pervades this country, for it is only from
the exercise of the mind that the body acquires the activity from
which I drew these inferences.&nbsp; Indeed, the King of
Denmark&rsquo;s German dominions&mdash;Holstein&mdash;appeared to
me far superior to any other part of his kingdom which had fallen
under my view; and the robust rustics to have their muscles
braced, instead of the, as it were, lounge of the Danish
peasantry.</p>
<p>Arriving at Sleswick, the residence of Prince Charles of
Hesse-Cassel, the sight of the soldiers recalled all the
unpleasing ideas of German despotism, which imperceptibly
vanished as I advanced into the country.&nbsp; I viewed, with a
mixture of pity and horror, these beings training to be sold to
slaughter, or be slaughtered, and fell into reflections on an old
opinion of mine, that it is the preservation of the species, not
of individuals, which appears to be the design of the Deity
throughout the whole of Nature.&nbsp; Blossoms come forth only to
be blighted; fish lay their spawn where it will be devoured; and
what a large portion of the human race are born merely to be
swept prematurely away!&nbsp; Does not this waste of budding life
emphatically assert that it is not men, but Man, whose
preservation is so necessary to the completion of the grand plan
of the universe?&nbsp; Children peep into existence, suffer, and
die; men play like moths about a candle, and sink into the flame;
war, and &ldquo;the thousand ills which flesh is heir to,&rdquo;
mow them down in shoals; whilst the more cruel prejudices of
society palsy existence, introducing not less sure though slower
decay.</p>
<p>The castle was heavy and gloomy, yet the grounds about it were
laid out with some taste; a walk, winding under the shade of
lofty trees, led to a regularly built and animated town.</p>
<p>I crossed the drawbridge, and entered to see this shell of a
court in miniature, mounting ponderous stairs&mdash;it would be a
solecism to say a flight&mdash;up which a regiment of men might
have marched, shouldering their firelocks to exercise in vast
galleries, where all the generations of the Princes of
Hesse-Cassel might have been mustered rank and file, though not
the phantoms of all the wretched they had bartered to support
their state, unless these airy substances could shrink and
expand, like Milton&rsquo;s devils, to suit the occasion.</p>
<p>The sight of the presence-chamber, and of the canopy to shade
the fauteuil which aped a throne, made me smile.&nbsp; All the
world is a stage, thought I; and few are there in it who do not
play the part they have learnt by rote; and those who do not,
seem marks set up to be pelted at by fortune, or rather as
sign-posts which point out the road to others, whilst forced to
stand still themselves amidst the mud and dust.</p>
<p>Waiting for our horses, we were amused by observing the dress
of the women, which was very grotesque and unwieldy.&nbsp; The
false notion of beauty which prevails here as well as in Denmark,
I should think very inconvenient in summer, as it consists in
giving a rotundity to a certain part of the body, not the most
slim, when Nature has done her part.&nbsp; This Dutch prejudice
often leads them to toil under the weight of some ten or a dozen
petticoats, which, with an enormous basket, literally speaking,
as a bonnet, or a straw hat of dimensions equally gigantic,
almost completely conceal the human form as well as face divine,
often worth showing; still they looked clean, and tripped along,
as it were, before the wind, with a weight of tackle that I could
scarcely have lifted.&nbsp; Many of the country girls I met
appeared to me pretty&mdash;that is, to have fine complexions,
sparkling eyes, and a kind of arch, hoyden playfulness which
distinguishes the village coquette.&nbsp; The swains, in their
Sunday trim, attended some of these fair ones in a more slouching
pace, though their dress was not so cumbersome.&nbsp; The women
seem to take the lead in polishing the manners everywhere, this
being the only way to better their condition.</p>
<p>From what I have seen throughout my journey, I do not think
the situation of the poor in England is much, if at all, superior
to that of the same class in different parts of the world; and in
Ireland I am sure it is much inferior.&nbsp; I allude to the
former state of England; for at present the accumulation of
national wealth only increases the cares of the poor, and hardens
the hearts of the rich, in spite of the highly extolled rage for
almsgiving.</p>
<p>You know that I have always been an enemy to what is termed
charity, because timid bigots, endeavouring thus to cover their
sins, do violence to justice, till, acting the demigod, they
forget that they are men.&nbsp; And there are others who do not
even think of laying up a treasure in heaven, whose benevolence
is merely tyranny in disguise; they assist the most worthless,
because the most servile, and term them helpless only in
proportion to their fawning.</p>
<p>After leaving Sleswick, we passed through several pretty
towns; Itzchol particularly pleased me; and the country, still
wearing the same aspect, was improved by the appearance of more
trees and enclosures.&nbsp; But what gratified me most was the
population.&nbsp; I was weary of travelling four or five hours,
never meeting a carriage, and scarcely a peasant; and then to
stop at such wretched huts as I had seen in Sweden was surely
sufficient to chill any heart awake to sympathy, and throw a
gloom over my favourite subject of contemplation, the future
improvement of the world.</p>
<p>The farmhouses, likewise, with the huge stables, into which we
drove whilst the horses were putting to or baiting, were very
clean and commodious.&nbsp; The rooms, with a door into this
hall-like stable and storehouse in one, were decent; and there
was a compactness in the appearance of the whole family lying
thus snugly together under the same roof that carried my fancy
back to the primitive times, which probably never existed with
such a golden lustre as the animated imagination lends when only
able to seize the prominent features.</p>
<p>At one of them, a pretty young woman, with languishing eyes of
celestial blue, conducted us into a very neat parlour, and
observing how loosely and lightly my little girl was clad, began
to pity her in the sweetest accents, regardless of the rosy down
of health on her cheeks.&nbsp; This same damsel was
dressed&mdash;it was Sunday&mdash;with taste and even coquetry,
in a cotton jacket, ornamented with knots of blue ribbon,
fancifully disposed to give life to her fine complexion.&nbsp; I
loitered a little to admire her, for every gesture was graceful;
and, amidst the other villagers, she looked like a garden lily
suddenly rearing its head amongst grain and corn-flowers.&nbsp;
As the house was small, I gave her a piece of money rather larger
than it was my custom to give to the female waiters&mdash;for I
could not prevail on her to sit down&mdash;which she received
with a smile; yet took care to give it, in my presence, to a girl
who had brought the child a slice of bread; by which I perceived
that she was the mistress or daughter of the house, and without
doubt the belle of the village.&nbsp; There was, in short, an
appearance of cheerful industry, and of that degree of comfort
which shut out misery, in all the little hamlets as I approached
Hamburg, which agreeably surprised me.</p>
<p>The short jackets which the women wear here, as well as in
France, are not only more becoming to the person, but much better
calculated for women who have rustic or household employments
than the long gowns worn in England, dangling in the dirt.</p>
<p>All the inns on the road were better than I expected, though
the softness of the beds still harassed me, and prevented my
finding the rest I was frequently in want of, to enable me to
bear the fatigue of the next day.&nbsp; The charges were
moderate, and the people very civil, with a certain honest
hilarity and independent spirit in their manner, which almost
made me forget that they were innkeepers, a set of
men&mdash;waiters, hostesses, chambermaids, &amp;c., down to the
ostler, whose cunning servility in England I think particularly
disgusting.</p>
<p>The prospect of Hamburg at a distance, as well as the fine
road shaded with trees, led me to expect to see a much pleasanter
city than I found.</p>
<p>I was aware of the difficulty of obtaining lodgings, even at
the inns, on account of the concourse of strangers at present
resorting to such a centrical situation, and determined to go to
Altona the next day to seek for an abode, wanting now only
rest.&nbsp; But even for a single night we were sent from house
to house, and found at last a vacant room to sleep in, which I
should have turned from with disgust had there been a choice.</p>
<p>I scarcely know anything that produces more disagreeable
sensations, I mean to speak of the passing cares, the
recollection of which afterwards enlivens our enjoyments, than
those excited by little disasters of this kind.&nbsp; After a
long journey, with our eyes directed to some particular spot, to
arrive and find nothing as it should be is vexatious, and sinks
the agitated spirits.&nbsp; But I, who received the cruellest of
disappointments last spring in returning to my home, term such as
these emphatically passing cares.&nbsp; Know you of what
materials some hearts are made?&nbsp; I play the child, and weep
at the recollection&mdash;for the grief is still fresh that
stunned as well as wounded me&mdash;yet never did drops of
anguish like these bedew the cheeks of infantine
innocence&mdash;and why should they mine, that never was stained
by a blush of guilt?&nbsp; Innocent and credulous as a child, why
have I not the same happy thoughtlessness?&nbsp; Adieu!</p>
<h2>LETTER XXIII.</h2>
<p>I might have spared myself the disagreeable feelings I
experienced the first night of my arrival at Hamburg, leaving the
open air to be shut up in noise and dirt, had I gone immediately
to Altona, where a lodging had been prepared for me by a
gentleman from whom I received many civilities during my
journey.&nbsp; I wished to have travelled in company with him
from Copenhagen, because I found him intelligent and friendly,
but business obliged him to hurry forward, and I wrote to him on
the subject of accommodations as soon as I was informed of the
difficulties I might have to encounter to house myself and
brat.</p>
<p>It is but a short and pleasant walk from Hamburg to Altona,
under the shade of several rows of trees, and this walk is the
more agreeable after quitting the rough pavement of either
place.</p>
<p>Hamburg is an ill, close-built town, swarming with
inhabitants, and, from what I could learn, like all the other
free towns, governed in a manner which bears hard on the poor,
whilst narrowing the minds of the rich; the character of the man
is lost in the Hamburger.&nbsp; Always afraid of the
encroachments of their Danish neighbours, that is, anxiously
apprehensive of their sharing the golden harvest of commerce with
them, or taking a little of the trade off their
hands&mdash;though they have more than they know what to do
with&mdash;they are ever on the watch, till their very eyes lose
all expression, excepting the prying glance of suspicion.</p>
<p>The gates of Hamburg are shut at seven in the winter and nine
in the summer, lest some strangers, who come to traffic in
Hamburg, should prefer living, and consequently&mdash;so exactly
do they calculate&mdash;spend their money out of the walls of the
Hamburger&rsquo;s world.&nbsp; Immense fortunes have been
acquired by the per-cents. arising from commissions nominally
only two and a half, but mounted to eight or ten at least by the
secret manoeuvres of trade, not to include the advantage of
purchasing goods wholesale in common with contractors, and that
of having so much money left in their hands, not to play with, I
can assure you.&nbsp; Mushroom fortunes have started up during
the war; the men, indeed, seem of the species of the fungus, and
the insolent vulgarity which a sudden influx of wealth usually
produces in common minds is here very conspicuous, which
contrasts with the distresses of many of the emigrants,
&ldquo;fallen, fallen from their high estate,&rdquo; such are the
ups and downs of fortune&rsquo;s wheel.&nbsp; Many emigrants have
met, with fortitude, such a total change of circumstances as
scarcely can be paralleled, retiring from a palace to an obscure
lodging with dignity; but the greater number glide about, the
ghosts of greatness, with the <i>Croix de St. Louis</i>
ostentatiously displayed, determined to hope, &ldquo;though
heaven and earth their wishes crossed.&rdquo;&nbsp; Still good
breeding points out the gentleman, and sentiments of honour and
delicacy appear the offspring of greatness of soul when compared
with the grovelling views of the sordid accumulators of cent. per
cent.</p>
<p>Situation seems to be the mould in which men&rsquo;s
characters are formed: so much so, inferring from what I have
lately seen, that I mean not to be severe when I
add&mdash;previously asking why priests are in general cunning
and statesmen false?&mdash;that men entirely devoted to commerce
never acquire or lose all taste and greatness of mind.&nbsp; An
ostentatious display of wealth without elegance, and a greedy
enjoyment of pleasure without sentiment, embrutes them till they
term all virtue of an heroic cast, romantic attempts at something
above our nature, and anxiety about the welfare of others, a
search after misery in which we have no concern.&nbsp; But you
will say that I am growing bitter, perhaps personal.&nbsp; Ah!
shall I whisper to you, that you yourself are strangely altered
since you have entered deeply into commerce&mdash;more than you
are aware of; never allowing yourself to reflect, and keeping
your mind, or rather passions, in a continual state of
agitation?&nbsp; Nature has given you talents which lie dormant,
or are wasted in ignoble pursuits.&nbsp; You will rouse yourself
and shake off the vile dust that obscures you, or my
understanding, as well as my heart, deceives me
egregiously&mdash;only tell me when.&nbsp; But to go farther
afield.</p>
<p>Madame la Fayette left Altona the day I arrived, to endeavour,
at Vienna, to obtain the enlargement of her husband, or
permission to share his prison.&nbsp; She lived in a lodging up
two pairs of stairs, without a servant, her two daughters
cheerfully assisting; choosing, as well as herself, to descend to
anything before unnecessary obligations.&nbsp; During her
prosperity, and consequent idleness, she did not, I am told,
enjoy a good state of health, having a train of nervous
complaints, which, though they have not a name, unless the
significant word <i>ennui</i> be borrowed, had an existence in
the higher French circles; but adversity and virtuous exertions
put these ills to flight, and dispossessed her of a devil who
deserves the appellation of legion.</p>
<p>Madame Genus also resided at Altona some time, under an
assumed name, with many other sufferers of less note though
higher rank.&nbsp; It is, in fact, scarcely possible to stir out
without meeting interesting countenances, every lineament of
which tells you that they have seen better days.</p>
<p>At Hamburg, I was informed, a duke had entered into
partnership with his cook, who becoming a <i>traiteur</i>, they
were both comfortably supported by the profit arising from his
industry.&nbsp; Many noble instances of the attachment of
servants to their unfortunate masters have come to my knowledge,
both here and in France, and touched my heart, the greatest
delight of which is to discover human virtue.</p>
<p>At Altona, a president of one of the <i>ci-devant</i>
parliaments keeps an ordinary, in the French style; and his wife
with cheerful dignity submits to her fate, though she is arrived
at an age when people seldom relinquish their prejudices.&nbsp; A
girl who waits there brought a dozen <i>double louis
d&rsquo;or</i> concealed in her clothes, at the risk of her life,
from France, which she preserves lest sickness or any other
distress should overtake her mistress, &ldquo;who,&rdquo; she
observed, &ldquo;was not accustomed to hardships.&rdquo;&nbsp;
This house was particularly recommended to me by an acquaintance
of yours, the author of the &ldquo;American Farmer&rsquo;s
Letters.&rdquo;&nbsp; I generally dine in company with him: and
the gentleman whom I have already mentioned is often diverted by
our declamations against commerce, when we compare notes
respecting the characteristics of the Hamburgers.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why, madam,&rdquo; said he to me one day, &ldquo;you will
not meet with a man who has any calf to his leg; body and soul,
muscles and heart, are equally shrivelled up by a thirst of
gain.&nbsp; There is nothing generous even in their youthful
passions; profit is their only stimulus, and calculations the
sole employment of their faculties, unless we except some gross
animal gratifications which, snatched at spare moments, tend
still more to debase the character, because, though touched by
his tricking wand, they have all the arts, without the wit, of
the wing-footed god.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Perhaps you may also think us too severe; but I must add that
the more I saw of the manners of Hamburg, the more was I
confirmed in my opinion relative to the baleful effect of
extensive speculations on the moral character.&nbsp; Men are
strange machines; and their whole system of morality is in
general held together by one grand principle which loses its
force the moment they allow themselves to break with impunity
over the bounds which secured their self-respect.&nbsp; A man
ceases to love humanity, and then individuals, as he advances in
the chase after wealth; as one clashes with his interest, the
other with his pleasures: to business, as it is termed,
everything must give way; nay, is sacrificed, and all the
endearing charities of citizen, husband, father, brother, become
empty names.&nbsp; But&mdash;but what?&nbsp; Why, to snap the
chain of thought, I must say farewell.&nbsp; Cassandra was not
the only prophetess whose warning voice has been
disregarded.&nbsp; How much easier it is to meet with love in the
world than affection!</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Yours sincerely.</p>
<h2>LETTER XXIV.</h2>
<p>My lodgings at Altona are tolerably comfortable, though not in
any proportion to the price I pay; but, owing to the present
circumstances, all the necessaries of life are here extravagantly
dear.&nbsp; Considering it as a temporary residence, the chief
inconvenience of which I am inclined to complain is the rough
streets that must be passed before Marguerite and the child can
reach a level road.</p>
<p>The views of the Elbe in the vicinity of the town are
pleasant, particularly as the prospects here afford so little
variety.&nbsp; I attempted to descend, and walk close to the
water&rsquo;s edge; but there was no path; and the smell of glue,
hanging to dry, an extensive manufactory of which is carried on
close to the beach, I found extremely disagreeable.&nbsp; But to
commerce everything must give way; profit and profit are the only
speculations&mdash;&ldquo;double&mdash;double, toil and
trouble.&rdquo;&nbsp; I have seldom entered a shady walk without
being soon obliged to turn aside to make room for the
rope-makers; and the only tree I have seen, that appeared to be
planted by the hand of taste, is in the churchyard, to shade the
tomb of the poet Klopstock&rsquo;s wife.</p>
<p>Most of the merchants have country houses to retire to during
the summer; and many of them are situated on the banks of the
Elbe, where they have the pleasure of seeing the packet-boats
arrive&mdash;the periods of most consequence to divide their
week.</p>
<p>The moving picture, consisting of large vessels and small
craft, which are continually changing their position with the
tide, renders this noble river, the vital stream of Hamburg, very
interesting; and the windings have sometimes a very fine effect,
two or three turns being visible at once, intersecting the flat
meadows; a sudden bend often increasing the magnitude of the
river; and the silvery expanse, scarcely gliding, though bearing
on its bosom so much treasure, looks for a moment like a tranquil
lake.</p>
<p>Nothing can be stronger than the contrast which this flat
country and strand afford, compared with the mountains and rocky
coast I have lately dwelt so much among.&nbsp; In fancy I return
to a favourite spot, where I seemed to have retired from man and
wretchedness; but the din of trade drags me back to all the care
I left behind, when lost in sublime emotions.&nbsp; Rocks
aspiring towards the heavens, and, as it were, shutting out
sorrow, surrounded me, whilst peace appeared to steal along the
lake to calm my bosom, modulating the wind that agitated the
neighbouring poplars.&nbsp; Now I hear only an account of the
tricks of trade, or listen to the distressful tale of some victim
of ambition.</p>
<p>The hospitality of Hamburg is confined to Sunday invitations
to the country houses I have mentioned, when dish after dish
smokes upon the board, and the conversation ever flowing in the
muddy channel of business, it is not easy to obtain any
appropriate information.&nbsp; Had I intended to remain here some
time, or had my mind been more alive to general inquiries, I
should have endeavoured to have been introduced to some
characters not so entirely immersed in commercial affairs, though
in this whirlpool of gain it is not very easy to find any but the
wretched or supercilious emigrants, who are not engaged in
pursuits which, in my eyes, appear as dishonourable as
gambling.&nbsp; The interests of nations are bartered by
speculating merchants.&nbsp; My God! with what <i>sang froid</i>
artful trains of corruption bring lucrative commissions into
particular hands, disregarding the relative situation of
different countries, and can much common honesty be expected in
the discharge of trusts obtained by fraud?&nbsp; But this
<i>entre nous</i>.</p>
<p>During my present journey, and whilst residing in France, I
have had an opportunity of peeping behind the scenes of what are
vulgarly termed great affairs, only to discover the mean
machinery which has directed many transactions of moment.&nbsp;
The sword has been merciful, compared with the depredations made
on human life by contractors and by the swarm of locusts who have
battened on the pestilence they spread abroad.&nbsp; These men,
like the owners of negro ships, never smell on their money the
blood by which it has been gained, but sleep quietly in their
beds, terming such occupations lawful callings; yet the lightning
marks not their roofs to thunder conviction on them &ldquo;and to
justify the ways of God to man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Why should I weep for myself?&nbsp; &ldquo;Take, O world! thy
much indebted tear!&rdquo;&nbsp; Adieu!</p>
<h2>LETTER XXV.</h2>
<p>There is a pretty little French theatre at Altona, and the
actors are much superior to those I saw at Copenhagen.&nbsp; The
theatres at Hamburg are not open yet, but will very shortly, when
the shutting of the gates at seven o&rsquo;clock forces the
citizens to quit their country houses.&nbsp; But, respecting
Hamburg, I shall not be able to obtain much more information, as
I have determined to sail with the first fair wind for
England.</p>
<p>The presence of the French army would have rendered my
intended tour through Germany, in my way to Switzerland, almost
impracticable, had not the advancing season obliged me to alter
my plan.&nbsp; Besides, though Switzerland is the country which
for several years I have been particularly desirous to visit, I
do not feel inclined to ramble any farther this year; nay, I am
weary of changing the scene, and quitting people and places the
moment they begin to interest me.&nbsp; This also is vanity!</p>
<h3>DOVER.</h3>
<p>I left this letter unfinished, as I was hurried on board, and
now I have only to tell you that, at the sight of Dover cliffs, I
wondered how anybody could term them grand; they appear so
insignificant to me, after those I had seen in Sweden and
Norway.</p>
<p>Adieu!&nbsp; My spirit of observation seems to be fled, and I
have been wandering round this dirty place, literally speaking,
to kill time, though the thoughts I would fain fly from lie too
close to my heart to be easily shook off, or even beguiled, by
any employment, except that of preparing for my journey to
London.</p>
<p>God bless you!</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Mary</span>
----.</p>
<h2>APPENDIX.</h2>
<p>Private business and cares have frequently so absorbed me as
to prevent my obtaining all the information during this journey
which the novelty of the scenes would have afforded, had my
attention been continually awake to inquiry.&nbsp; This
insensibility to present objects I have often had occasion to
lament since I have been preparing these letters for the press;
but, as a person of any thought naturally considers the history
of a strange country to contrast the former with the present
state of its manners, a conviction of the increasing knowledge
and happiness of the kingdoms I passed through was perpetually
the result of my comparative reflections.</p>
<p>The poverty of the poor in Sweden renders the civilisation
very partial, and slavery has retarded the improvement of every
class in Denmark, yet both are advancing; and the gigantic evils
of despotism and anarchy have in a great measure vanished before
the meliorating manners of Europe.&nbsp; Innumerable evils still
remain, it is true, to afflict the humane investigator, and hurry
the benevolent reformer into a labyrinth of error, who aims at
destroying prejudices quickly which only time can root out, as
the public opinion becomes subject to reason.</p>
<p>An ardent affection for the human race makes enthusiastic
characters eager to produce alteration in laws and governments
prematurely.&nbsp; To render them useful and permanent, they must
be the growth of each particular soil, and the gradual fruit of
the ripening understanding of the nation, matured by time, not
forced by an unnatural fermentation.&nbsp; And, to convince me
that such a change is gaining ground with accelerating pace, the
view I have had of society during my northern journey would have
been sufficient had I not previously considered the grand causes
which combine to carry mankind forward and diminish the sum of
human misery.</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
