description: '"This engaging volume was pioneering feminist Mary Wollstonecraft''s
  most popular book during her lifetime. Difficult to categorize, it is both an arresting
  travel book and a moving exploration of her personal and political selves. Wollstonecraft
  set out for Scandinavia just two weeks after her first suicide attempt, on a mission
  from the lover whose affections she doubted, to recover his silver on a ship that
  had gone missing. With her baby daughter and a nursemaid, she traveled across the
  dramatic landscape and wrote sublime descriptions of the natural world, and the
  events and people she encountered. Fascinating appendices include Imlay''s commission
  to recover his lost silver, Wollstonecraft''s recently discovered letter to the
  Danish Prime Minister asking for assistance, the private letters she wrote to Imlay
  during her travels in Scandinavia, a chapter from Godwin''s memoir of Wollstonecraft,
  and a selection of contemporary reviews. About the Series: For over 100 years Oxford
  World''s Classics has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around
  the globe. Each affordable volume reflects Oxford''s commitment to scholarship,
  providing the most accurate text plus a wealth of other valuable features, including
  expert introductions by leading authorities, voluminous notes to clarify the text,
  up-to-date bibliographies for further study, and much more."--Publisher''s website.'
